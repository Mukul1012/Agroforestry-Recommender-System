Certain plant species, though, harbor bacteria in their roots that convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form that plants can absorb. Farmers and gardeners use these plants as cover crops—inedible species grown in the off-season for the purpose of replacing the nutrients consumed by harvested crops—to produce nitrogenWhen plants dont receive sufficient nitrogen, theyre unable to produce enough amino acids to make the proteins that plant cells need to grow. Nitrogen fixation is thus an incredibly important part of maintaining the environment and providing humans with food crops. Farmers and gardeners can use chemical nitrogen fertilizer to keep crops thriving, but synthetic fertilizer can pollute drinking water and poses a threat to fish and other wildlife. Biological nitrogen fixation helps crops flourish without introducing pollutants to the environmentNitrogen-fixing plants form a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. These microorganisms serve as a microbial inoculant, infecting the host plant’s root system and causing it to form nodules where the bacteria can thrive. Inside these root nodules, the bacteria draw nitrogen gas from the air, turning it into fixed nitrogen that is able to be absorbed and used by the plant hostOnce the host plant dies, the bacteria are released back into the soil where they either stay put or infect another legume. The decomposed legume also becomes a form of green manure for farms and vegetable gardens, releasing its stored nitrogen into the soil along with other nutrients and organic matter. This green manure then serves as a nitrogen source for the next crop rotationLegumes (members of the plant species Fabaceae) are common nitrogen-fixing plants. Legume plants form a symbiotic relationship with a type of nitrogen-fixing bacteria called Rhizobium. Actinorhizal plants are certain species of non-legume trees and shrubs that have a symbiotic association with a nitrogen-fixing bacteria called Frankia. Popular types of nitrogen-fixers for home gardens include:Ground cover plants: Vetch, cowpea, lupine flower, soybean, clover, peanut, alfalfa, and Austrian winter peaShort trees and shrubs: Russian olive, autumn olive, seaberry, acacia, and Siberian pea shrubTall trees: Black locust, black alder, and empress tree')\n",

       "'Nitrogen level is low, nitrogen fixation required Nitrogen is the element responsible for lush green plant growth, but plants arent actually able to use the nitrogen gas in Earths atmosphere. Certain plant species, though, harbor bacteria in their roots that convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form that plants can absorb. Farmers and gardeners use these plants as cover crops—inedible species grown in the off-season for the purpose of replacing the nutrients consumed by harvested crops—to produce nitrogenWhen plants dont receive sufficient nitrogen, theyre unable to produce enough amino acids to make the proteins that plant cells need to grow. Nitrogen fixation is thus an incredibly important part of maintaining the environment and providing humans with food crops. Farmers and gardeners can use chemical nitrogen fertilizer to keep crops thriving, but synthetic fertilizer can pollute drinking water and poses a threat to fish and other wildlife. Biological nitrogen fixation helps crops flourish without introducing pollutants to the environmentNitrogen-fixing plants form a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. These microorganisms serve as a microbial inoculant, infecting the host plant’s root system and causing it to form nodules where the bacteria can thrive. Inside these root nodules, the bacteria draw nitrogen gas from the air, turning it into fixed nitrogen that is able to be absorbed and used by the plant hostOnce the host plant dies, the bacteria are released back into the soil where they either stay put or infect another legume. The decomposed legume also becomes a form of green manure for farms and vegetable gardens, releasing its stored nitrogen into the soil along with other nutrients and organic matter. This green manure then serves as a nitrogen source for the next crop rotationLegumes (members of the plant species Fabaceae) are common nitrogen-fixing plants. Legume plants form a symbiotic relationship with a type of nitrogen-fixing bacteria called Rhizobium. Actinorhizal plants are certain species of non-legume trees and shrubs that have a symbiotic association with a nitrogen-fixing bacteria called Frankia. Popular types of nitrogen-fixers for home gardens include:Ground cover plants: Vetch, cowpea, lupine flower, soybean, clover, peanut, alfalfa, and Austrian winter peaShort trees and shrubs: Russian olive, autumn olive, seaberry, acacia, and Siberian pea shrubTall trees: Black locust, black alder, and empress tree'"
