 Abelmoschus moschatus,"Local names:
 Arabic (hhabb el misk,anbar bûl), Chinese (ye you ma,shan you ma,huang ku,huang kai), English (ornamental okra,musky-seeded hibiscus,musk okra,musk mallow,annual hibiscus,fautia,yorka okra), French (Ambretté,graine de musc,ketmie mosqué,gombo mosqué), Ge
Abelmoschus moschatus is a delightful, soft, herbaceous trailing plant, 0.5-2.5 meters high with soft hairy stems and a long slender tap root. It has an underground tuber and dies back to this tuber in the dry season, emerging again with the first substantial rains of the wet season.
Leaves alternate, rough, hairy,heart-shaped or 3-5 palmately lobed with serrated margins and linear-oblong or triangular lobes, 4-10cm x 4-9 cm.

Flowers regular, bisexual, involucral bracts 8-12, hibiscus-like, usually watermelon pink but sometimes white or cream - always with a dark center, very prolific and are borne between October and April in some places, depending on the timing of the wet season.


Fruit a hirsute capsule, 6-8 cm long, ovoid-cylindrical.


Seeds subreniform and black, held in hairy, tough but papery capsules, musky-scented
The generic name Abelmoschus is derived from Arabic ‘abu-l-mosk’ (father of musk) in allusion to the smell of the seeds whereas the specific epithet means ‘musk smelling’.
Ecology

Usually weedy in open and disturbed areas. In Australia, it occur  in open woodlands or grasslands, most often found on rocky hillsides but sometimes on flat lands. In Guam, it occurs in marshy locations.  In Fiji, it is found from near sea level to an elevation of about 450 m as a weed naturalized in gardens, plantations, ricefields, and clearings, and also occurring along trails and on the edges of forests.

Tree management

Ambrette is cultivated as pre-kharif crop in India. It is usually sown in March-April but as late as the first week of July in Central India. Seed rates of 41g/kg are optimum. Application of dried Neem leaves (500Kg/ha) at last ploughing increased oil content and quality. April sown crop start flowering in September; fruits ripen from November to January and are harvested when fully mature. Application of fertilizers improves growth of plant, and seed yields but some studies indicate that use of chemical inputs result in negative impact on oil content and quality. Harvested capsules are sun dried and seeds dehisce when the capsules burst. The oil for perfumery is extracted by steam distillation of crushed seeds.

Propagation may be from seeds, small tubers or stem cuttings. Seeds germinate readily but some difficulty is often experienced in getting the plant to establish in the ground. Sowing the seeds in situ in a well drained, rocky spot may be the best answer. The plant should be allowed to dry out when foliage dies off during the dry season.
 It is a relative of the edible Okra and tubers and foliage were a source of food for Aborigines.
Fibre: The bark is processed into fibre and e root mucilage as a sizing for paper.
Medicines: In India, roots, leaves (rarely), and seeds of ambrette are considered valuable traditional medicines. The bitter, sweet, acrid, aromatic seeds are used as a tonic and are considered aphrodisiac, opthalmic, cardiotonic, digestive, stomachic, constipating, carminative, pectoral, diuretic, stimulant, antispasmodic, deodorant, and effective against  intestinal complaints, stomatitis; and diseases of the heart, allays thirst and checks vomiting. According to Unani system of medicine seeds allay thirst, cure stomatitis, dyspepsia, urinary discharge, gonorrhea, leucoderma and itch. Roots and leaves are cures for gonorrhea.
Essential oils: Ambrette oil obtained from seeds posses an odor similar to that of musk and its aromatic constituents have long been used in perfumery industry. Different grades of essential, or aromatic absolute, are marked in Europe as high-grade perfum"
Acacia aneura,"Local names:
 English (mulga,dark heartwood), Trade name (mulga)
Acacia aneura is a perennial, evergreen, often single-stemmed tree, 10-15 m tall in high rainfall areas. Trunk brown, short, fissured and sometimes twisted. Bark at base of trunk fissured, greyish, 1 cm thick; upper parts thinner, smoother and often light grey. Branches ascending; branchlets angular, covered with dense, silvery hairs; young shoots brown, scaly and occasionally resinous. Tree develops a long taproot and an extensive lateral root system in the top 30-cm of the soil.

Phyllodes flat, silvery grey-green, thick, leathery, narrow, lanceolate-shaped, 2-25 cm long, 1-10 mm wide, with many faint parallel nerves obscured by a dense covering of short hairs; margins usually lighter, tips blunt, curved or oblique with a small basal gland.

Flowers bright yellow, slender, short, dense, 1-3 cm long , 5-7 mm wide, and borne on dense, axillary, cylindrical spikes; stalks 3-8 mm long.

Pods light brown, 2-5 cm long, 7-15 mm wide, very obtuse, oblong, flat, membranous, thin, usually with a narrow but prominent membranous winged margin as wide as 2 mm. Seeds oval, flat, 3-5 x 2-4 mm, a shiny dark brown, oblique or transverse in the pod, with a hard testa; veins netlike; base narrow; tip very blunt; stalk thin and short, with 2 or 3 folds thickening into a small basal aril.

The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning point or barb.
The species name was first published in Linnaea 26:627 (1855) and comes from the Greek word 'a' (not) and 'neuron' (a nerve), in allusion to the absence of conspicuous veins on the phyllodes. The standard trade name (Mulga) is an Aboriginal word for a long narrow shield made from Acacia wood.
Ecology

Mulga is the one of the dominant species in Australian shrub woodlands. Natural populations extend over an area of 1.5 million km sq, chiefly in climates where the annual rainfall is 200-250 mm. Mulga ranges in elevation from sea level to 300 m. In many of the drier parts of its distribution mulga occurs as the only species in groves up to 50 m wide and 400 m long with intergrove areas acting as water catchments to provide substantial run-on water. In the eastern part of its range in northern New South Wales and Queensland mulga is found in semiarid conditions with a mean annual rainfall of 300-500 mm. It experiences hot summers and coot winters with light frosts. Soils supporting mulga are usually acidic sands or sandy loams, which permit easy filtration of water into the upper horizons, but are usually very low in nitrogen and available phosphorus. A. aneura can live for more than 50 years, it is drought-tolerant, but very fire sensitive.

Australia
Tree management

Nursery growth is slow with seedlings often taking 6-8 months to reach 20 cm tall. When transplanted to the field the seedlings usually require several months without severe moisture stress to survive and in and areas may need supplementary irrigation. Established seedlings have the ability to survive severe drought. They develop a long taproot and an extensive lateral root system in the top 30 cm of the soil. A. aneura needs to be protected from browsing animals while young. In short-term management, grazing needs to be controlled to maintain ground cover, which reduces rainfall runoff and soil erosion. Chemical control of weeds, which is costly, is practiced for special cases and small areas. Lopping is practiced to provide animal feed during the dry season. Regular periods of rest from browsing of trees by livestock are essential for seeding, re-growth and fodder accumulation. Growth rate is generally slow but is related to moisture conditions. In central Australia planted specimens receiving an average of 370 mm of rainfall a year grew in ten years into multi-stemmed shrubs 3 m tall and 2-4 cm dbh with a crown diameter of 2 m. Cultivated specimens receiving regular irrigation have reached 10 m tall and 10 cm dbh in 10 years. In trials where rainfall is relatively high, the Charleville, Queensland provenance, a broad phyllode form, has grown more rapidly than provenances from central Australia. Trees with different phyllode forms have been observed to have different growth rates.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox with 13% germination following 20 years of open storage at room temperature. Viability is maintained for 13 years with air-dried seeds stored at room temperature and increases with seed age up to 3 years. Dormancy is evident in fresh seed but disappears after 1 year. On average, there are 50 000-110 000 seeds/kg.

Soils supporting mulga are usually acidic sands or sandy loams, which permit easy filtration of water into the upper horizons, but are usually very low in nitrogen and available phosphorus. A. aneura can live for more than 50 years, it is drought-tolerant, but very fire sensitive.
A. aneura is propagated using seedlings and does not resprout after cutting. Forest fires, fluctuating temperatures and subsequent wetting and drying break seed dormancy naturally. Immersing seeds in hot water (90 deg. C) for 1 minute or in sulphuric acid for 30 minutes or mechanically scarifying them artificially breaks dormancy. Seeds can be supplied with carbon dioxide-rich air to enhance germination rates. Optimum germination temperatures are 20-30 deg. C. Seeds sown in a germination tray are ready for separating into containers within 10 days. The potting mix needs to drain freely but have good moisture holding capacity.
The Australian Aborigines ground the mulga seed for flour. The seeds have a protein content comparable to dried split peas or peanuts.
In many parts of Australia the drought-resistant mulga forms a significant part of a sheep's diet at all times of the year but without supplementary high quality feed it supplies protein and energy barely sufficient for maintenance of dry-range sheep. Phyllodes have a high crude protein level (11-16%), low phosphorus content (0.05-0.1-2%) and good palatability. Excessive grazing may result in the death of mulga.
Apiculture: Good supplies of pollen are provided when there is adequate moisture. It is an important pollen producing species, important to beekeepers.
The wood is excellent for firewood and charcoal.
Timber: The heartwood of mulga is dark brown with contrasting markings of golden yellow; the sapwood is white. The wood is very hard, heavy (850-1100 kg/cum ) and durable in the ground; it turns well and takes a high polish. The aborigine people of Australia use the wood to make weapons and small ornaments. 
Shade or shelter: A. aneura can be used in the arid areas to provide shelter and shade.
Gum or resin:  Australian aborigines use the resinous phyllodes of A. aneura as an adhesive resin.
Nitrogen fixing: It forms nodules with Rhizobium with which it exhibits a degree of specificity. Ectomycorrhizal associations have been observed and there is almost certainly VA mycorrhizal symbiosis. The nitrogen-fixing capacity of the tree contributes significantly to the nitrogen economy of the soil.
Ornamental: A. aneura has attractive silvery grey foliage, making it a popular choice for amenity plantings.
Wood is used for fence posts in Australia."
Acacia angustissima,"Local names:
 English (white ball acacia,Prairie acacia,fernleaf acacia,fern acacia), Spanish (timbre,palo de pulque timbe,guajillo,cantemo,barba de chivo)
Acacia angustissima grows as a thornless shrub or small tree mostly 2-7 m tall with a single short trunk. It exhibits much variation in pubescence, size and venation of the leaflets and size of flowers and heads. 

The leaves are mostly asymmetric with a displaced mid-vein, 10-25 cm long, with 10-20 pairs of pinnae and leaflets without secondary venation.

The inflorescences are ellipsoidal with whitish heads 1-1.5 cm in diameter, turning pinkish to dull orange when dried.

The pod is oblong, 3-6 cm long and 6-9 mm wide, with straight or sinuate margins. The pods are initially green, turning coffee-brown as they ripen.

A. angustissima has six varieties (var. angustissima; var. hirta; var. suffruticosa; var. chisosiana; var. leucothrix and var. oaxacana). The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning point or barb.
Ecology

In its natural range A. angustissima is found on hillsides, rock slopes, summits, and in grassland with other shrubs. It is often found in tropical deciduous or semi-deciduous forest. It tolerates cold climates (occasional temperatures below freezing) and free-draining acid soils. It also withstands periods of drought, possibly due to its substantial taproot, retaining its green foliage in the long (sometimes 8 months as in Timor, Indonesia) dry season.
Native range
Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, United States of America
Tree management

A. angustissima is a relatively fast growing tree, sometimes achieving a 5 m height and about 6 cm diameter after 2 .5 years. When introducing A. angustissima into a new area it may be necessary to inoculate with an appropriate Rhizobium before planting. Weeds can suppress early growth and the establishment of the seedlings; it is therefore necessary to maintain a weed free zone around the seed or seedling.

The application of fertilizer to A. angustissima has been shown to have different effects depending on when added. Fertilizer added to seeds had a negative effect on emergence and did not improve the competitive ability of the seedling against weeds once it started to grow. Once A. angustissima is established the application of fertilizer has a positive effect on the growth of the tree.

A. angustissima grows rapidly and responds well to regular cutting. However, it produces weak branches that break off in moderate winds. This ability to grow quickly has resulted in A. angustissima becoming weedy and forming thickets, especially along roadsides and in sandy soil in pastures in its native range. This weed potential has created concern among some researchers about the advisability of its use in agroforestry or agricultural systems.
The seeds are very small, 90 000-100 000 seeds/kg.

It also withstands periods of drought, possibly due to its substantial taproot, retaining its green foliage in the long (sometimes 8 months as in Timor, Indonesia) dry season.
A. angustissima seems to fare better when grown from transplanted seedlings than from direct seeding. If it is to be directly seeded, then it is important not to sow too deeply. The seeds should be sown on the surface of cultivated soil and covered with a layer of soil equal to the width of the seed. The best pre-treatment results from 12 hours soaking in cold water before sowing. The standard hot-water treatment (a two-minute soak in hot water followed by 12 hours in cold water) results in inferior germination. Scratching or nicking the round end of each seed with a file, knife or nail clipper (without damaging the cotyledon) before sowing has also been suggested.
Although A. angustissima may not grow into a large tree, it can be extremely valuable for use as pioneer species for rejuvenating degraded lands, and as a nurse crop for more-valuable tree species.
A. angustissima produces large amounts of foliage with fodder potential. The crown architecture enables the tree to withstand frequent cuttings or defoliation with a high recovery and growth rate. A. angustissima has also been shown to respond well to coppicing. Biomass production has been shown to range from 10.3 t DM ha-1 to 11.4 t DM ha-1, at 2-m spacing. At 3-m spacing the biomass increases to a range from 11.5 t DM ha-1 to 12.4 t DM ha-1. These figures are based on cutting the trees back to 50 cm above ground level and on yearly cuttings taken during, and/or at the end of the wet season. Research shows that A. angustissima cuttings contain high levels of N, P and K, but due to a high tannin content (6% DM), the protein is less accessible to the livestock. Tests have shown that A. angustissima leaves degrade poorly in the rumen of cows (48% after 48 hours of incubation. A. angustissima has been found to produce significantly more leaves than other shrub legumes, notably Leucaena spp., Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, Cajanus cajan, and Sesbania spp. However, the high tannin content and low palatability means it is of limited nutritional value to livestock.  In feeding trials at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Ethiopia, sheep fed 300 g of A. angustissima supplement per head per day died between 9 days and 21 days after consuming only 75-100 g per head per day at any time. This shows that the feed may contain toxins, and that the sheep did not particularly like it.  In some areas of Indonesia A. angustissima leaf is reported to be eaten well and is regarded as an important source of forage.
Medicine:  Although A. angustissima is not commonly used for agroforestry in its native range, it is an important medicinal species for the Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya Indians in Mexico. They rank it the 4th most important species in the cure of bloody diarrhea and 7th in the treatment of mucoid diarrhea. It is also used as a cure for toothache, rheumatism and skin lesions, and is reported to inhibit growth in malignant tumors. Tests also show that A. angustissima possesses a mild antimicrobial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
Nitrogen fixing: A. angustissima forms an association with soil Rhizobium to fix atmospheric nitrogen.
Soil improver: Its potential as a mulch producer has come into question, because of the presence of secondary compounds that bind the Nitrogen and result in low-quality (slowly decomposing) prunings. This may mean that the mulch is a poor Nitrogen source for the present crop, but it may have greater residual effects that could benefit the subsequent crop, or be a good Nitrogen source to help build up organic matter in the soil. These long-term benefits could outweigh the initial low nutrient return to the soil over a number of years. Slowly decomposing prunings may have value for suppressing weed growth in associated crops. 
Intercropping:  No information has been found about A. angustissima being used within farming systems in its native habitat. In Papua New Guinea, trials have been carried out using A. angustissima in an alley cropping system intercropped with sweet potato. A. angustissima provided enough N, P and K for the crop, but due to the rapid growth shaded the crop and inhibited the tuber yield.
Alcohol:  The bitter astringent bark is used in Mexico for precipitating mucilaginous matter and inducing fermentation in the making of alcoholic drinks."
Acacia auriculiformis,"Local names:
 Bengali (akash mono,sonajhuri), English (Japanese acacia,Australian wattle,coast wattle,Darwin black wattle,earleaf acacia,earpod black wattle,earpod wattle,wattle,tan wattle,northern black wattle,Papua wattle), Filipino (auri), Hindi (sonajhuri,kasia,ak
Acacia auriculiformis is an evergreen tree that grows between to 15-30 m tall, with a trunk up to 12 m long and 50 cm in diameter. It has dense foliage with an open, spreading crown. The trunk is crooked and the bark vertically fissured. Roots are shallow and spreading.

Leaves 10-16 cm long and 1.5-2.5 cm wide with 3-8 parallel nerves, thick, leathery and curved.

Flowers are 8 cm long and in pairs, creamy yellow and sweet scented.

Pods are about 6.5 x 1.5 cm, flat, cartilaginous, glaucous, transversely veined with undulate margins. They are initially straight but on maturity become twisted with irregular spirals. Seeds are transversely held in the pod, broadly ovate to elliptical, about 4-6 x 3-4 mm.

The generic name acacia comes from the Greek word ‘akis’ meaning a point or a barb and the specific epithet comes from the Latin ‘auricula’- external ear of animals and ‘forma- form, figure or shape, in allusion to the shape of the pod.
Ecology

A. auriculiformis occurs from near sea level to 400 m, but is most common at elevation less than 80 m. It is predominantly found in the seasonally dry tropical lowlands in the humid and sub-humid zones. The mean annual rainfall in its natural range varies from 700-2000 mm, and the dry season (i.e. monthly rainfall less than 40 mm) may be 7 months. The mean maximum temperature of the hottest month is 32-34 deg C and the mean minimum of the coolest month is 17-22 deg C. 
The species is commonly riparian, i.e. ringing perennial rivers and semi-perennial creeks, and tends to form discontinuous populations along drainage systems.

Seedlings have the ability to compete with Imperata cylindrica during early growth phases and once mature may reduce the grass to a sparse ground cover.

Frost does not occur in its natural range, but elsewhere, it tolerates light frost. It does not tolerate shade, and strong wind easily breaks its branches.
Native range
Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea
Tree management

Newly emerged seedlings should receive 50% shade. Once they are established, 70% full sunlight is optimal. In genera, 3-4 months are needed to raise transplantable seedlings that are 25 cm tall. The optimal planting density is not clearly established. Most current plantings are spaced at 2-4 x 2-4 m, the closer spacing being more suitable for firewood and pulp plantations. Removal of lower branches and of young plants has been suggested as a means of improving stem form and of reducing the incidence of multiple stems. A. auriculiformis responds well to pollarding. Young trees respond to coppicing better than old trees, but the tree does not sprout vigorously or prolifically. Best results are obtained if the stump is cut at a height of 0.6-1 m above the ground. Under favourable conditions, trees may reach a height of 15 m in 5 years and produce an annual wood increment of 15-20 cubic m/ha over 10-12 years.
An increment in height of 2-4 m per year in the first few years is common even on soils of low fertility. On relatively fertile Javanese soils receiving 2 000 mm annual rainfall, a mean annual increment of 15-20 m³/ha is obtainable but on less fertile or highly eroded sites the increment is reduced to 8-12 m³/ha. Recommended rotation is 4-5 years for fuelwood, 8-10 years for pulp and 12-15 years for timber. One or two thinnings are required with longer rotations, depending on initial spacing, site quality and tree growth.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seeds retain viability for several years. There are approximately 55 000-75 000 seeds/kg.

Seedlings have the ability to compete with Imperata cylindrica during early growth phases and once mature may reduce the grass to a sparse ground cover.

Frost does not occur in its natural range, but elsewhere, it tolerates light frost. It does not tolerate shade, and strong wind easily breaks its branches.
Seeds picked at physiological maturity do not show dormancy, but mature seeds require a pre-germination treatment, such as immersion in boiling water for 1-2 minutes followed by soaking in cold water overnight or soaking in warm water for 24 hours; 40-80% germination occurs between 6-15 days. Direct seed sowing by hand has been successful. Plantations are established using seedlings raised in containers. In general, 3-4 months are needed to raise seedlings to a plantable size, 25 cm in height. Inoculation with appropriate rhizobia may be beneficial, especially when seedlings are raised in sterilized soil. Methods of vegetative propagation through juvenile cutting have been developed and are now a routine and simple operation.
The spreading, densely-matted root system stabilizes eroding land. Its rapid early growth, even on infertile sites, and tolerance of both highly acidic and alkaline soils make it popular for stabilizing and revegetating mine spoils.
Erosion control:  Its spreading, superficial and densely matted root system makes A. auriculiformis suitable for stabilizing eroded land.
Not widely used as fodder, but in India 1-year-old plantations are browsed by cattle.
Apiculture:  The flowers are a source of pollen for honey production.
A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark.
Fibre:  The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Large-scale plantations have already been established, as in Kerala, India, for the production of pulp.
Timber:  The sapwood is yellow; the heartwood light brown to dark red, straight grained and reasonably durable. The wood has a high basic density (500-650 kg/m³), is fine-grained, often attractively figured and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available. 
Shade or shelter:  The dense, dark-green foliage, which remains throughout the dry season, makes it an excellent shade tree. Planted to provide shelter on beaches and beachfronts.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark contains sufficient tannin (13-25%) for commercial exploitation and contains 6-14% of a natural dye suitable for the soga-batik industry. In India, the bark is collected locally for use as tanning material. A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark.
Nitrogen fixing: Acacia auriculiformis can fix nitrogen after nodulating with a range of Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium strains. It also has associations with both ecto- and endo-mycorrhizal fungi. 
Ornamental: It is used for shade and ornamental purposes in cities where its hardiness, dense foliage and bright yellow flowers are positive attributes.
Soil improver:  Plantations of A. auriculiformis improve soil physio-chemical properties such as water-holding capacity, organic carbon, nitrogen and potassium through litter fall. Its phyllodes provide a good, long-lasting mulch.
Intercropping:  The effect of intercropping with annual crops varies. Increased tree growth has been found with kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus), upland rice and groundnut in Thailand; reduced growth with maize in Cameroon."
Acacia catechu,"Local names:
 Burmese (sha), English (betel-nut palm,black cutch,catechu tree,cutch tree,heartwood), French (acacie au cachou), Hindi (khair,supari,sundra,cachu,koir,tallatuma), Malay (pinang), Nepali (khair,khaira), Sanskrit (khadir), Tamil (karungali,kamugu,paku,bag
Acacia catechu is a small or medium-sized, thorny tree up to 15 m tall; bark dark grey or greyish-brown, peeling off in long strips, or sometimes in narrow rectangular plates, brown or red inside; branches slender, puberlous when young but glabrascent, with 2 curved, 8-mm prickles at the base of each petiole.

Leaves bipinnately compound, with 9-30 pairs of pinnae and a glandular rachis; leaflets 16-50 pairs, oblong-linear, 2-6 mm long, glabrous or pubescent.

Flowers in 5-10 cm long axillary spikes, pentamerous, white to pale yellow, with a campanulate calyx, 1-1.5 mm long, and a corolla 2.5-3 mm long; stamens numerous, far exserted from the corolla, with white or yellowish-white filaments.

Fruit a strap-shaped pod, 5-8.5 cm x 1-1.5 cm, flat, tapering at both ends, shiny, brown, dehiscent, 3-10 seeded; seeds broadly ovoid.

In India, three varieties, namely:  var. catechu, var. catechuoides and var sundra are recognized.

The generic name, ‘acacia’, comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning a point or a barb. 

The species name comes from 'cutch', a tanning extract isolated from its heartwood.
Ecology

A. catechu occurs naturally in mixed deciduous forests and savannas of lower mountains and hills. It is especially common in the drier regions on sandy soils of riverbanks and watersheds.
Native range
India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand
Tree management

Early growth is slow, and in Thailand the mean annual diameter increment is only 0.8-1.3 m. Weeding is essential, especially when the plants are still young. Protection against fire is necessary, especially in the drier parts of its range, and so is protection from grazing animals. Rotation regimes depend upon the intended use: for fuelwood production, felling is usually at 10-15 years of age; trunks with a diameter of 30-35 cm are considered the most economic. For extracting the tanning agent cutch, this size may not be achieved for 30 years.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. According to different authors, viability is lost within 1 year in hermetic storage at room temperature at 11-15% mc; viability is maintained for at least 2 years at ambient temperature; viability is maintained for 9 months in open storage at room temperature; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 10 deg. C. There are 15 000-40 000 seeds/kg.
A. catechu occurs naturally in mixed deciduous forests and savannas of lower mountains and hills. It is especially common in the drier regions on sandy soils of riverbanks and watersheds.
A. catechu can be raised from direct sowing,coppice, planting out nursery-raised seedlings or by stump planting. It is recommended, but not necessary, to put the seeds in boiling water and then leave for 24 hours them to cool.
Poison:  The bark is said to be toxic and contains an alkaloid and both fruit and stem are used in Myanmar to poison fish. 
  Seeds contain water-soluble mucilage (6.8%); a good protein source but nutritionally incomplete with respect to essential amino acids.
It is considered to be a good fodder tree and is extensively lopped to feed goats and at times cattle. For leaf fodder, finger-thick branches are lopped usually before main leaf fall occurs.
The wood is excellent firewood. The calorific value of sapwood is estimated at 5 142 kcal/kg, heartwood 5 244 kcal/kg. Dry wood on destruction gives 38.1% charcoal of very good quality.
Timber:  Comparatively heavy with a density of 880-1 000 kg/cubic m at 15% mc. It is recommended to saw the comparatively heavy wood of A. catechu when green; the wood is also very strong, durable and resistant to white ants. Timber is used for house posts, agricultural implements and wheels. Spent chips left over after extraction of katha and cutch can be used for the manufacture of hardboards.
Tannin or dyestuff:  A substance called cutch, which is marketed as a solid extract, can be isolated from the heartwood. Depending on the way of processing, several products can be obtained from crude cutch. The dark catechu or Pegu cutch is used to tan heavy hides into sole leather, often in a mixture of tan stuffs. Catechu extract is also used for dyeing silk, cotton, canvas, paper and leather to a dark-brownish colour.
Medicine:  Khersal, a crystalline form of cutch sometimes found deposited in cavities of the wood is used medicinally for the treatment of coughs and sore throat. The bark is said to be effective against dysentery, diarrhoea and in healing of wounds. The seeds have been reported to have an antibacterial action. In East Africa, the powdered bark, mixed with sulphate of copper and egg yolk, is applied to cancerous growths.
Gum or resin:  The bark exudes a light gum of very good quality and is one of the best substitutes for gum arabic.

Acacia cincinnata,"Local names:
A. cincinnata grows up to 25 m tall and 40 cm diameter in moist parts in the tropics, but on drier sites of its natural range, it is a small tree less than 10 m in height. Bark compact, moderately hard, longitudinally fissured, grey-brown showing red-brown in the fissures. Young shoots covered with silky, golden yellow hairs, spines absent.

Mature phyllodes bright green, oblong lanceolate or falcate, 10-16 cm long and 1.5-3 cm wide with 3 prominent longitudinal veins running into each other on the lower margin near the base. There is a prominent raised gland at the base of the phyllode.

Flowers axillary spikes, 3-4 cm long, almost white to pale yellow and very faintly perfumed.

Pods linear, spirally and tightly coiled and glaucous when immature. Seeds longitudinal in the pod, 3-5 mm long, 2-3 mm wide. The aril is large and open, and a rather fine yellow funicle encircles the seed.

The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning point or barb. The specific name is from the Latin ‘cincinnatus’, meaning ‘with curls’, and refers to the pods, which are spirally coiled. Its nearest relative is probably A. spirobis ssp. solandri. It is also closely related to A. polystachya, A. mangium and possibly A. auriculiformis.
Ecology

A. cincinnata is adapted to the humid tropics and subtropics. The trees grows best on lowlands and foothills but extends to the somewhat hilly tablelands and can withstand seasonal waterlogging. It is intolerant to frost and drought. Throughout much of its range, this acacia grows with fringing rainforest or as a constituent of rainforest regrowth areas. Confined to the east coast of Queensland in 2 main areas, in northern Queensland from Cairns to Mackay and in the south from Fraser Island to Brisbane. There are isolated occurrences on the lower slopes of the moister coastal ranges, such as the Eungella Range, between the main areas of distribution. In northern Queensland on some sites, A. cincinnata is codominant with A. aulacocarpa, A. mangium, A. polystachya and closed forest trees such as Alstonia muellerana. On other sites, it occurs with Acacia crassicarpa, A. flavescens, Eucalyptus intermedia, E. pellita, E. tereticornis and E. torelliana. In the south of its range, A. cincinnata is a component of open forest or tall open forest of eucalypts including Eucalyptus intermedia, E. microcorys, E. pilularis and E. resinifera. It is also recorded as a shrub occurring in the drier parts of swamps dominated by Melaleuca spp.
Native range
Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga
Tree management

Saplings may be coppiced at higher cutting heights (about 0.5 m) but show limited regrowth if cut near ground level. Trees are site sensitive, being prone to premature senescence, gummosis and crown thinning if planted off site. The stem form can vary markedly in field trials, from specimens with a straight, tapering bole and small, horizontal branches to a bushy shrub, indicating the importance of species site matching and screening of provenances before embarking on broad-scale plantings. Best performance is achieved on deep, loamy soils and a short dry season. Trees have shown good wind resistance to tropical cyclones and typhoons. Growth rate is moderate in the early years, typically 1.5-2.5 m/year. Height growth and a dbh of 1-2.5 cm/year are recorded in humid parts of Southeast Asia. The most rapid growth has been recorded from an ex-forest site in Sabah, Malaysia, where annual height growth increment was 4.1m/year and dbh increment of 3 cm/year. On favourable sites, the rotation period for sawn timber is expected to be about 25 years.
A. cincinnata is easily propagated from seed, which has an orthodox storage behaviour. There are about 82,000 viable seeds/kg and germination rate is about 80% .

It is also recorded as a shrub occurring in the drier parts of swamps dominated by Melaleuca spp.
Trees are easily propagated from seed. Seeds require pretreatment with concentrated sulphuric acid for 0.5-2 hours, or are immersed into boiling water for 30 seconds, followed by draining and soaking in tap water for 24 hours. Germination rate averages 80%. A nursery phase of 3-4 months is suitable, and the seedlings are transplanted at the 3-leaf stage into containers, or are amenable to direct sowing in the field if weeds are controlled initially. Early growth and crown development are less than for other acacia species, and a greater attention to weed control is necessary for the 1st few years. Superior individual trees of this species have potential for vegetative reproduction.
Erosion control: A. cincinnata has been successfully employed to restore land that has been degraded by slash-and-burn agriculture in Laos; also suitable for reforestation on poor soils.
Young trees resprout well following cutting and have potential for production of animal fodder, if palatability and nutrient levels are satisfactory.
A dense wood that burns well when dry.
Fibre:  The wood may be a suitable source of kraft pulp with high screened pulp yield (77%), high pulpwood productivity (308 kg/cubic m) and acceptable bleaching characteristics. It has excellent potential as a source for fibre pulp in papermaking industries. 
Timber:  Wood is dark brown, attractively marked, close-grained, hard, tough, with a basic density of 510-580 kg/cubic m; it is somewhat greasy in nature. It is used for decorative purposes including cabinet work and turnery, and is also suitable for poles and posts. The wood is reportedly resistant to the teredo marine borer and may be useful for some marine purposes.
Shade or shelter:  It is suitable as a shade tree for cardamom and cocoa.
Nitrogen fixing: A. cincinnata nodulates and is nitrogen fixing.
Trees are suitable as supports for passion fruit and yams.
Intercropping:  It has been grown infrequently as an exotic but appears to have excellent potential for agroforestry purposes when planted on suitable sites, for example in southern China"
Acacia crassicarpa,"Local names:
 English (thick-podded salwood,red wattle,Papua New Guinea red wattle,northern wattle,brown salwood)
Acacia crassicarpa is a small- to medium-sized tree 25 m (max. 30) tall; bole often straight and branchless for about 13-18 m; up to 50-60 cm in diameter; crown heavily branched and spreading. Bark dark or grey brown, hard with deep vertical furrows; inner bark is red and fibrous.

Phyllodes falcate, 8-27 x 1-4.5 cm, greyish-green, glabrous; primary veins 3-5, prominent, longitudinal, tending to run into the lower margin at the base; secondary veins parallel, not anastomosing, crowded; pulvinus, 4-20 mm long with a circular gland at the top.

Inflorescence a bright yellow spike, 4-7 cm long, clustered in groups of about 2-6 in the upper axils; peduncle 5-10 mm long, rachis thick; flowers pentamerous, bisexual; calyx broadly cupular, 0.5-0.7 mm long, lobes concave, lobed to about halfway down; corolla widely spreading, glabrous, 1.3-1.6 mm long, 2-3 times as long as the calyx; stamens 2-3 mm long; ovary shortly pubescent, more densely hairy at the top.

Pod woody, ovoid-oblong, flat, 5-8 x 2-4 cm, glabrous, dull brown, transversely veined but hardly reticulate. Seed oblongoid, 5-6 x 2-3 mm, black, arranged separately in separate compartments; areole large and almost closed; funicle folded and thickened, forming a long, pale creamy-yellow aril below the seed.

The generic name acacia comes from the Greek word ‘akis’ meaning a point or a barb, 
and the specific epithet is from Latin, 'crassus' (thick) and  'carpus'  (fruit), in reference to its thick pod.
Ecology

The species is found in warm to hot humid and sub-humid zones in the lowland tropics. In Australia, it is commonly found immediately behind beaches, on coastal plains and foothills. It appears to be tolerant of salt spray and soil salinity. In Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya, Indonesia, A. crassicarpa is found on the gently undulating terrains on well-drained, strongly acid soils, and on imperfectly drained soils that flood in the wet season. On former rainforest wetlands with a sandy loam soil it is superior in growth to Acacia mangium. In the southern coastal lowlands of Queensland the species occurs in the understorey of open forest and in open woodland dominated by Eucalyptus pellita, E. tereticornis or E. tessellaris. On frontal sand dunes it is found as a wind-sheared shrub or small tree, behind Casuarina equisetifolia and associated with Alphitonia exelsa. On Cape York Peninsula, it is associated with Eucalyptus tetrodonta, Allocasuarina littoralis and Melaleuca spp. In Papua New Guinea, northern wattle occurs frequently with Acacia aulacocarpa, A. auriculiformis and A. mangium.
Native range
Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea
Tree management

Under favourable conditions seedlings grow rapidly reaching 25-30 cm in 3-4 months. A. crassicarpa is one of the fastest growing tropical Acacia species. It appears to maintain active shoot growth almost the year round, although a few months of stagnation may occur in the dry season. On sites dominated by Imperata cylindrica or other weedy plants, weed control is necessary in the first 1-2 years to ensure establishment. Coppicing ability varies with cutting height and provenance, but is not a suitable method of regeneration, since trees do not coppice well. In open situations, the crown is strongly branched and casts a moderate shade. Preliminary observations indicate that A. crassicarpa is resistant to low intensity fires. An aboveground dry biomass of 207 t/ha can be obtained in 3 years with mean annual rainfall of 1 500 mm, and 40 t/ha in 3 years on poorer sites.

Spacing of 3 x 3 m (1 100 trees/ha) to 4 x 4 m (625 trees/ha) is suitable for land reclamation, fuelwood and pulpwood plantations.
The seeds of A. crassicarpa have a hard seed coat, low moisture content and are well-suited to storage in an air-tight container at room temperature (24°C). The seeds weigh about  36 400 seeds/kg.

Seeds remain viable for many years and heat treatment or nicking of the seed coat is required to break dormancy. Immersion in boiling water for 1 minute is also a suitable treatment. Treated seeds are sown in germination beds, and seedlings with 2 pairs of leaves can be transplanted into polythene bags containing a mixture of soil and river sand. They are raised under partial shade, then in the open, and planted out when stem height reaches 25-30 cm. Inoculation of nursery seedlings with a selected Rhizobium strain prior to planting out is recommended for maximum nodule development. Vegetative propagation through air-layering has given promising results in Thailand.

Cuttings may be successful for trees up to 3 years old but older trees are difficult to root. Marcotting is effective for older specimens.
The tree can be planted for weed control and is often cited as an effective species for the rehabilitation of land infested with Imperata cylindrica. In Papua New Guinea, it is reported to be a very vigorous colonizer of degraded soils following shifting cultivation. Although suitable for planting for land reclamation, it is too competitive to grow in combination with annual crops.
The wood dries out moderately rapidly, burns well and is useful for firewood and charcoal, although it sparks at ignition and produces some fly ash and smoke during flaming. Its energy value is 22 600 kJ/kg.
Fibre:  A. crassicarpa is suitable for kraft pulping, with a moderate screened pulp yield of 47%, and excellent pulpwood productivity (300 kg per cubic metre). Fast-grown plantation wood of lower density may prove more suitable for pulp production than wood from native trees.
Timber:  The sapwood is pale yellowish-brown and heartwood golden-brown. The wood is strong and durable with a density of 670-710 kg/cubic metre. It is suitable for a wide range of sawn timber end-uses including light structural and decorative purposes. Examples include construction, furniture, flooring, board and boat building and tobacco curing firewood as is the case in  Tanzania.
Shade or shelter:  A. crassicarpa provides suitable shade.
Nitrogen fixing:  A. crassicarpa is a vigorous atmospheric nitrogen fixer and nodulates well with a group of related Rhizobium strains.
Soil improver:  Leaves decompose slowly and are useful as mulch."
Acacia elatior,"Local names:

Acacia erioloba,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (kameeldoring), English (giraffe thorn,rubber thorn tree,camel thorn), Hindi (odassithai,jala,karodei), Lozi (muhoto), Ndebele (umdwadwa,umwhohlo), Nyanja (mkunku,nyafungo), Somali (jifjif,sarmaan), Tongan (mungoshia), Tswana (mogotlho)
A large, spreading tree, 9-10 (max. 18) m high, branching about 2 m above the ground; occasionally a shrub barely 2 m tall; crown rounded, dense, spreading up to 18 m; branches drooping at the ends; sapwood yellow and the under bark  is reddish; bark dark greyish-brown to blackish, rough, fibrous, fissured, often flaking off in thick, woody strips when old; young twigs shiny, purplish or reddish, without hairs, distinctively zigzag shaped; taproots, long.

Leaves with 2-5 pairs of pinnae, each bearing 8-15 pairs of bluish-green leaflets 4-10 x 1-4 mm, remaining conspicuously green in the dry season; thorns dark brown, later grey or whitish, in pairs at the nodes, stout and straight, 1-5 cm long, at right angles to each other and pointing in the opposite direction to the previous pair; base of older thorns often inflated into an enlarged ant-gall 0.5-2 cm wide.

Inflorescence consists of a ball of bright golden yellow, solitary or clustered, fragrant flowers.

Pods green, broad, large, 1.3-2.5 cm thick but flattened, spongy within, half-moon shaped, 6-13 x 1.8-6.5 cm, curved through to 90-180 degrees, semi-woody, indehiscent, covered in dense grey hairs and containing hard, brown seeds that lie in several rows; some pods thin, round and long.

The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning a point or a barb. The scientific name ‘erioloba’ is Latin for ‘half-moon shaped’, referring to the shape of the pods.
Ecology

A. erioloba is frost and drought resistant. It is the dominant tree on the desert plains, sometimes occurring in beds or on the banks of rivers. Trees occurring outside this favoured habitat are usually stunted. Young plants require large amounts of light.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

A. erioloba, which bears valuable pod crops, can be grown on perennial grassland at a rate of 5-10 trees/ha without damage to the grass yield. It is advisable that the tree be grown in the habitat to which it is naturally adapted. 
The number of pods/tree is 25-1 200, and each pod weighs 7.4-30.2 g. The total weight of pods produced is about 600 kg/ha, with an annual yield of pods from a natural stand of mature trees being conservatively estimated at 1-2 t/ha. Cattle pass large quantities of seeds (about 50 seeds/dropping) in their dung. This facilitates bush encroachment by A. erioloba and other acacias with indehiscent pods. It is therefore included among 1652 taxa shown to be weedy in certain situations in southern Africa. It competes with other plants for space, light and nutriment. This species is valued throughout its range for its products and services and is rarely the subject of eradication measures. Two chemicals that are selective of woody species, tebuthiuron and ethidimuron, successfully control the species should it become a problem. Fire causes young A. erioloba trees to coppice and well-established, scrubby trees may thickening up.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seeds retain their viability for many years even at room temperature. Bruchid larvae within the seed continue to be active after the seed has been extracted and stored. The adults or larvae of some species emerge and may even re-enter the exit holes to lay eggs or to produce a 2nd generation of larvae that feed on the seed. Storage at temperatures near freezing point reduces bruchid beetle activity, and subzero temperatures of -20-30 deg. C may kill the larvae without damaging the seed. On average there are 22 000 seeds/kg.
A. erioloba is frost and drought resistant. It is the dominant tree on the desert plains, sometimes occurring in beds or on the banks of rivers. Trees occurring outside this favoured habitat are usually stunted. Young plants require large amounts of light.
Natural and artificial regeneration from seed is poor, even after presowing treatment, but trees coppice and sucker fairly readily. Seed germination rates are improved by planting seeds along with dung from cattle that have been feeding on the pods. This is because bruchid larvae that normally infest seeds are usually killed during their passage through the gut of a herbivore. Seedlings are best sown singly in containers and have to be transplanted quickly as the taproot develops rapidly. They should be planted out when 46 cm or more in height and should be watered for the 1st few months, after which they become drought resistant.
Poison:  The prussic acid that is sometimes present in the pods and foliage may poison animals.
Erosion control:  A. erioloba has been planted to help in sand dune stabilization, thus is useful in combating soil erosion.
A. erioloba produces a good quality, edible gum. Seeds have been used as a substitute for coffee.
Leaves and pods are eaten by livestock and are a valuable source of fodder in the dry season. Pods are highly nutritious, their feeding value matching that of legume hay; a noticeable increase in the milk yield of cows that have eaten them has been reported.
Apiculture:  Flowers are a source of nectar for honeybees.
A. erioloba is a source of firewood for much of the Kalahari region in southern Africa.
Timber:  The wood is hard, durable and resistant to borers and termites. The heartwood is dark purple and has been used for poles, especially for the center posts for houses, mine props, wagon building, utensils and even machinery (but the machinery must be kept well oiled). Roots are used as a substitute for reeds to make flutes.
Shade or shelter:  Mature trees provide shade in desert areas and the wood is used for construction of enclosures in southern Africa.
Medicine:  Gum from the tree is used as a cure for gonorrhea. Bark is burned, crushed and used for relieving headache. Pods are ground into a powder to treat ear infections. Roots are used as a cough remedy.
Ornamental:  The beautiful tree is suitable for planting in amenity areas."

Ornamental:  The tree is a common ornamental throughout the tropics.
Soil improver:  It performs very well on poor soils and in view of its unpalatability to livestock, its use as an alternative to L. leucocephala as a shrub legume deserves wider attention.
Intercropping:  It was originally planted as an undershrub in teak plantations in Indonesia."
Acacia holosericea,"Local names:
 English (candelabra wattle)
Acacia holosericea attains an average height of less than 8 m, with numerous branches beginning from the base, giving it a multi-stemmed appearance. The bark is smooth and green in the young plant.

Phyllodes measure 10-25 x 1.5-10 cm, are thick, with 3-5 longitudinal veins. 

Flowers small, bright yellow, cattail-like spikes, 3-6 cm long.

Pods narrow, coiled, 3-6 x by 2.5-5 cm, in dense clusters; contain small, oval, slightly flattened, shiny, black seeds measuring 2 x 3-5 mm.

The generic name acacia comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning a point or a barb.
The species name is derived from the Greek 'holo' (entire/whole) and the Latin 'sericeus' (silky, with long straight close-pressed glossy hairs), in reference to the indumentum of the plant.
Ecology

The early and abundant seeding of A. holosericea has the potential of making it a weed.
Native range
Australia
Tree management

Lopping and pollarding are recommended. Generally A. holosericea does not coppice well.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; 11% viability lost after 14 years storage at room temperature. There are 100 000-175 000 seeds/kg. Seed pretreatment with boiling water for 1 minute is necessary to break dormancy and enhance germination.
The early and abundant seeding of A. holosericea has the potential of making it a weed.
Natural vegetation from self-seeding occurs freely in the native habitat of A. holosericea. Planting seedlings in polythene bags is the most reliable method of artificial propagation. For successful germination, boiling water should be poured over the seeds, after which they are soaked for 24 hours.
Grows fast, has a dense crown, fixes nitrogen and has vigorous colonizing characteristics. These make it ideal for revegetation and restoration of degraded mining sites and fixation of sand dunes.
  Seeds are edible, but consumption is limited by chances of toxicity, the labour-intensive procedure of preparating them for making flour, and their unpleasant odour.
Large quantities of phyllode biomass, produced during the dry season when other acacias shed their leaves, is a valuable fodder source. However, fodder should be dried before it is fed to livestock, as fresh phyllodes are not palatable for cattle and sheep, and there are reports from Niger of goats dying after consuming them. Crude proteins and digestibility are low, due to their high concentrations of tannins, which limit the availability of the protein component. Trees 4 years old have reportedly produced about 3 t/ha of dry phyllodes.
The wood, an excellent fuel that can readily be converted to charcoal, is hard with high density (ca. 870 kg/cubic meter). The calorific value of wood is estimated at 4670 kcal/kg and of charcoal 7536 kcal/kg. Early rapid growth makes A. holosericea a highly productive fuelwood source. Trees 4 years old can yield up to 13 t/ha.
Shade or shelter:  Due to its large dense crown, A. holosericea is used to form the lower part of a multistorey windbreak with Eucalyptus camaldulensis.
Ornamental:  A. holosericea is becoming a popular species for planting in towns and for roadside windbreaks. The silvery foliage, early appearance of its yellow flower spikes and prominent twisted pods make it an attractive ornamental shrub. Its relatively short life span of 4-8 years is a limiting factor."
Acacia karroo,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (doringboom,soetdoring,witdoring,karoodoring), English (white-thorn,sweet thorn,Cape thorn tree,mimosa thorn,karoo-thorn), Ndebele (isinga), Shona (mubayamhondoro,muunga,munenje), Tswana (mookana,mooka), Xhosa (umNga), Zulu (umNga,isiKhombe)
Acacia karroo is an evergreen tree 3-15 m tall, rarely shrubby; bark on trunk dark red-brown to blackish; young branchlets glabrous or rarely sparsely and inconspicuously puberulous, also with small inconspicuous pale to reddish sessile glands; epidermis flaking off to expose a dark rusty red, not powdery under bark, sometimes grey to brown and persistent; stipules spinescent, up to 7 (max. 17) cm long, rather robust, whitish, often deflexed, sometimes fusiform-inflated, up to 1 cm or more.

Leaves with small to large (sometimes paired) gland at the junction of each pinna-pair, rarely lacking at the basal 1-2 pairs; sometimes a large gland on the upper side of the petiole; pinnae 2-7 pairs; leaflets 5-15 pairs, 4-7 x 1-3 mm, glabrous or rarely with minutely ciliolate margins, glandular, obtuse to subacute but not spinulose-mucronate at the apex; lateral nerves invisible on the underside.

Flowers deep or golden yellow, in axillary pedunculate heads 8-12 mm in diameter borne along shoots of the current season, sometimes aggregated into leaflets’ terminal racemes. Calyx 1.25-2 mm long, subglabrous; corolla 2.5-3 mm long, glabrous or almost so.

Pods dehiscent, 6-16 x 0.6-0.9 cm, linear, falcate, usually constricted between the seeds, glabrous except for small usually inconspicuous glands; seeds olive-green to brown, 5-8 x 3-5 mm, oblong-elliptic, compressed; areole 4.5-5.5 x 2-3.5 mm.

The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning a point or a barb. The specific name ‘karoo’ does not signify that this is a species of the Karroo alone, but that it is a principal and most conspicuous tree of this semi-desert of southern Africa.
Ecology

A pioneer species with a climax of 40 years, it occupies a successional position between the tropical forest and the bushveld. It grows in riverine communities and even in arid environments, where it can do well provided there is an assured supply of groundwater. Large specimens are an indicator of underground water. A. karroo is included in the national weed list in South Africa. It competes for space, water and nutrients with pasture grasses, thus replacing them. Sweet thorn is frost- and drought-tolerant.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Stand establishment  of this species is either through natural regenerations or planting stock. A. karroo tolerates drought, fire, frost and termites. It also regenerates rapidly through suckers and fixes nitrogen. It is difficult to handle due to its thorns, and it is an aggressive colonizer, easily taking over grasslands. Its invasive root system means that it is unsuitable for planting near buildings or paved pathways.
Seed must be soaked in hot water, left overnight, and then sown the next morning. Seeds are planted either directly into small black nursery bags or in flat seedling trays filled with seedling mix. Seeds germinate in 3-12 days.

A. karroo is included in the national weed list in South Africa. It competes for space, water and nutrients with pasture grasses, thus replacing them. Sweet thorn is frost- and drought-tolerant.
In its natural range, A. karroo is reported as being easy to raise from seed and has been planted widely for firewood on experimental plots in South Africa and Botswana.
Poison:  Roots are placed in fowl runs to control external parasites.
It is universally accepted for use as a rehabilitation plant in degraded sites and dunes. It flushes when the temperatures are highest and before the rains, when there is a great need for shade to reduce soil temperatures.
  The gum is eaten as a confection; seeds are substitute for coffee, and children chew the sweet thorns.
Foliage, flowers and green pods are important browse for livestock. Cattle do not browse it as much as do goats, when it is the only green forage in the woodland at the end of the dry season. Green foliage and pods contain 14-15% proteins (as percentage of dry matter).
Apiculture:  The long flowering season makes it a useful tree for apiculture. Bees collect pollen and nectar from the flowers.
It burns brightly, with very little smoke and no odour. It splits easily and once dried does not absorb moisture from the atmosphere. It has calcium oxalate crystals that give its embers high temperatures and make them long lasting. These clean burning traits, ideal for cooking and heating, make it excellent firewood wherever it grows. In the coastal dunes of Zululand, South Africa, it is reputed as an excellent charcoal source.
Fibre:  Root bark is used for twine and rope (like in the traditional Nama mat house).
Timber:  Few trees reach a commercial size, limiting their commercial use. The wood saws easily, planes to a smooth finish, is moderately durable, and glues and varnishes well for furniture. It is, however, likely to twist in seasoning and is susceptible to attack by borers and fungi. Kraft properties have been tested, and it pulps quite easily under standard kraft macro-pulping conditions.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The Nama people of southern Africa extract a red dye from the bark. The bark contains up to 19% tannins, which when used for tanning, give the leather a red colour.
Medicine:  In Zimbabwe, a root infusion is taken for pain in the alimentary canal, rheumatism, convulsions, gonorrhea and as an aphrodisiac. Root powder is applied to penile sores for syphilis. A bark decoction is an emetic for diarrhoea in humans and ‘tulp’ poisoning in cattle.
Gum or resin:  A.  karroo gum is used regionally in southern Africa as a substitute for gum arabic. It cannot be exported to Europe or the USA because it has not been cleared for toxins. Annual production is 25-30 t/ha.
Nitrogen fixing:  Nodulation increases soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. In the communal areas of Zimbabwe, it is well known that dryland crop yields increase where A. karroo has grown and been cleared.
Soil improver:  It stimulates the development of an understorey of perennials, palatable and nutritious grasses (Cenchrus ciliaris, Panicum maximum) through providing them shade, fixing nitrogen and improving soil structure and infiltration. A.  karroo is considered to be a good indicator of fertile soils for crops and an indicator of surface or underground water.
Intercropping:Its deep root system and nodulation make A. karroo suitable for intercropping."
Acacia koa,"Local names:
 English (koa acacia,koa,Hawaiian mahogany), Hawaian (koa), Trade name (koa)
Acacia koa is a large, evergreen tree to 25 m tall, stem diameter to 150 cm at breast height. Trees occurring in dense, wet native forest stands typically retain a straight, narrow form. In the open, trees develop more spreading, branching crowns and shorter, broader trunks. A. koa has one main tap root and an otherwise shallow, spreading root system. Bark gray, rough, scaly and thick.

A. koa belongs to the thorn-less, phyllodinous group of the Acacia subgenus Heterophyllum. Young seedlings have bipinnate compound true leaves with 12-15 pairs of leaflets. Where forest light is sufficient, seedlings stop producing true leaves while they are less than 2 m tall. True leaves are retained longer by trees growing in dense shade. Phyllodes are sickle-shaped and often more than 2.5 cm wide in the middle and blunt pointed on each end.

Inflorescence is a pale yellow ball, 8.5 mm in diameter, 1-3 on a common stalk. Each inflorescence is composed of many bisexual flowers. Each flower has an indefinite number of stamens and a single elongated style.

Pods are slow to dehisce, 15 cm long and 2.5-4 cm wide. They contain 6-12 seeds that vary from dark brown to black.

The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning point or barb.
Ecology

Occurring in both pure and mixed forest stands, A. koa is most commonly associated with the native ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha). It is also a co-dominant in several other major forest types including Koa/Mamane(Sophora chrysophylla) Montane Dry Forest and Koa/Ohia/A'e (Sapindus soponaria) Forest.
Native range
United States of America
Tree management

On favorable sites, planted seedlings grow to 9 m in 5 years. Its wide branching form is the result of open growth. Dense stocking of seedlings, which mimics the competitive environment where superior trees grow, encourages straight and rapid height growth. Initial spacing of 1.2 x 1.2 m is currently recommended. Observation indicates that effective self-thinning results in an adequate number of potential crop trees by age 25.

Plantation establishment is most easily and successfully accomplished through the stimulation of natural regeneration where scattered A. koa cover is adequate. Pasture soils are scarified and competition from grasses reduced by the application of a contact herbicide. Gaps in the regeneration are filled with planted seedlings. Fertilizers are applied to give seedlings an initial boost. Plantation thinning prescriptions should be based on desired products and management capabilities. The most important factors to consider in picking A. koa crop trees is stem form and height. Seed production begins when trees are 5 years old. A. koa bears seed often and abundantly.
The seeds are durable and easy to store. They germinate after many years of storage if kept in a cool, dry place. The most effective method for improving seed germination is mechanical scarification. However, hot water soaking works well and is a more practical method, seed should be soaked in boiled water for 24 hours. Seeds are seldom dispersed far from the tree and remain viable in the soil for up to 25 years.
Occurring in both pure and mixed forest stands, A. koa is most commonly associated with the native ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha). It is also a co-dominant in several other major forest types including Koa/Mamane(Sophora chrysophylla) Montane Dry Forest and Koa/Ohia/A'e (Sapindus soponaria) Forest.
Propagation is most successful from seed. Once treated, seeds are sown in nursery beds. 1 week after germination, seedlings are transplanted into nursery tubes or bags. Seedlings are ready for transplanting into the field when they are approximately 20 cm tall, (after 3-4 months in the nursery). Establishment by direct seeding or encouragement of natural regeneration is recommended as heart rot occurs during transplanting. One study recommends air-layering as the best vegetative propagation technique.
Most A. koa plantations in Hawaii have been established to provide vegetative cover on sites degraded by decades of intense grazing.
Cattle, sheep and pigs browse A. koa foliage aggressively, especially its juvenile leaves.
Apiculture:  The tree is visited by the honey bee and may be a source of nectar.
Timber: A. koa heartwood is highly valued for its unique grain, varied color and workability. It seasons well without serious warping or splitting. Curly-grained wood, the result of both stress and genetics, is preferred over straight-grained wood. Wood color ranges from a subtle yellow to a striking dark red-purple. The specific gravity of wood averages 0.40, but with curly-grained wood can be as high as 0.65. It is the premier Hawaiian timber for furniture, cabinetry, interior work and woodcrafts.
Nitrogen fixing: A. koa is nodulated by the slow-growing Bradyrhizobium spp. common in tropical soils. It nodulates heavily in a variety of soils, suggesting it is effective with a wide variety of Bradyrhizobia strains."
Acacia laeta,"Local names:
 Arabic (subahi,shubahi,kitr achbash), Tigrigna (kenteb)

Timber:  Wood is used for local construction.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Animal skins are tanned using a watery solution derived form the bark of trees.
Wood of A. laeta is used to make fence posts. The tree can tolerate repeated browsing giving it a good potential as a hedging tree"
Acacia leptocarpa,"Local names:
Acacia leptocarpa varies from a single-stemmed shrub, 3-5 m tall, usually with a short main stem, to a small tree 12-15 m tall; main trunk may be 4 m long and 25 cm in diameter. It is well branched and has a light to moderately dense crown. The branchlets and new shoots are glabrous, but the shoots are encrusted with a layer of brown resin; on large trees the bark is deeply furrowed, but on smaller stems it is thin and more or less tessellated.

Phyllodes are sickle shaped, 12-26 x 1-3.5 cm, thinly textured, glabrous; base attenuated and not confluent with the lower margin; 3 prominent, yellowish longitudinal veins with parallel and widely spaced secondary veins.

Flowers pale yellow to bright yellow, subdensely arranged in cylindrical spikes, 3.5-9.5 cm long, spikes in groups of 2-5 within phyllode axils.

Pods are linear, somewhat coiled, up to 12 cm x 3 mm, flat but raised over the seeds; seeds are longitudinal in the pod, 3-5 x 2-3 mm, and the yellow-orange funicle is folded many times to form an aril that can be longer than the seed.

The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning a point or a barb.
The specific name is derived from the Greek 'lepos'-slender and 'carpos'-fruit, alluding to the slender pods.
Ecology

A. leptocarpa  occurs in coastal and sub-coastal belts. It prefers hot humid to sub-humid climatic zones. In Australia the tree usually occurs on the flats and gentle slopes of the coastal lowlands, including stabilized dunes, but it extends to the slopes and ridges further inland.

Spines 2-5 mm long, at the base of leaves.

Flowers conspicuous, light-yellow to cream in colour, in pendunculate glomerules aggregated in terminal or axillary panicles, 5-merous, corolla 1.2-2 mm long.

Pods yellow, green or brown in colour, flat and fairly straight, 10-20 cm long, 5-10 mm wide, containing 10-20 smooth, oblong seeds, dark brown in colour, 6 x 4 mm in size.

The generic name ‘acacia’ comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning point or barb.
Ecology

A. leucophloea is a tree of tropical and subtropical climate. It is a component of dry-forests, savannas, bush woodlands, and desert ecosystems from sea level to elevations of 800 m. In these areas, rainfall is only 400-1 500 mm/year and dry seasons may persist for 9-10 months. Temperatures are extreme, varying from –1-49 deg C.
Native range
Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Direct sowing in the field can be done in lines 3 m apart and thinned after the first growing season to 0.5 m. Seedlings should be planted at 2.5-3 m x 2.5-3 m in July when I year old. Weed control must be maintained for a minimum of two years. Livestock must be excluded from plantations. Annual cultivation around the seedlings improves growth and survival. On fertile soils, A. leucophloea seedlings grow quickly, up to 60 cm a year. Under irrigation, height growth may reach 7-10 m in 5-6 years. Seedlings are light demanding and sensitive to weed competition, fire and frost. In order to exploit sufficient soil moisture, seedling root growth generally exceeds shoot growth. Once established, trees are very tolerant of drought, fire and frost. Pruned or injured trees produce thorny branches and stump sprouts. The tree coppices well, mean annual increment over the 12-year rotation period is 9 cu m/ha of stem wood and 11 cu m/ha for wood over 7 cm diameter.
There are 37 000-50 000 seeds/kg. Pretreatment is necessary to break the hard seed coat. To encourage uniform germination, seed should be scarified either by submerging in boiled water for 24 hours or soaking in sulfuric acid for 10-30 minutes followed by soaking in cool water for 24 hours. The visibly swollen seeds should be sown immediately. Seed storage behaviour is probably orthodox. Viability can be maintained for up to 2 years at room temperature.

In these areas, rainfall is only 400-1 500 mm/year and dry seasons may persist for 9-10 months. Temperatures are extreme, varying from –1-49 deg C.
A. leucophloea can be established by direct sowing, stump sprouts or seedlings. Direct sowing is preferred because the large roots of seedlings may hamper transplanting. Site should be cleared of weeds and the soil well cultivated. Sowing in the nursery is done in June-July with the commencement of monsoon rains. Seed should be sown at a depth of 1 cm in lines 20-25 cm apart. Germination begins within a week.
A. leucophloea is a good reforestation species for poor soils in low rainfall areas.
 The germinated seeds are cooked and eaten as a vegetable. They contain crude protein 27 % dry matter. The other major nutrient contents are crude lipid 5 %, crude fibre 7 %, ash 4 % and total crude carbohydrates, 58 %. 

The seeds are a rich source of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron and manganese. The predominant seed protein fractions are globulins and albumins. 



The essential amino acids, cystine, methionine, tyrosine and phenylalanine, have been found to be low and threonine, valine, isoleucine and lysine fairly high compared with the FAO/WHO/UNO amino acid recommended pattern. 



The lipids contain high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in which linoleic acid (51 %) is the major fatty acid.

 A. leucophloea is an important dry-season fodder and pasture tree throughout its range. Leaves, tender shoots and pods are eagerly consumed by goats, sheep and cattle. 

Leaves contain 15% crude protein and 19% crude fiber. However, due to hydrocyanic acid toxicity 

A. leucophloea should not be used as a sole feed.
It is appreciated as firewood and is suitable for charcoal production.
Fibre: Fibres from the inner bark are used to make fish nets and rough rope.
Timber: Its wood is strong, heavy and hard, density 720-890 kg/cu m at 15 % moisture content. It seasons well and takes a good polish. The brick-red heartwood is very beautiful and is used to make decorative furniture. The pale yellow sapwood is perishable. The utilization of this species is limited because its wood has irregular interlocked grain, a rough texture and is difficult to work. Commodities produced from the wood include poles, farming implements, carts, wheels, turnery, indoor construction timbers, flooring and furniture.
Shade or shelter: During dry seasons, this tree protects livestock and understory pasture from excessive temperatures. The tree is suitable as a firebreak due to its fire resistance.
Tannin or dyestuff: The leaves yield a black dye and the bark produces a reddish-brown substance used to manufacture dyes and tannins.
Medicine:  Gum is used medicinally.
Gum or resin: A water-soluble gum of fair quality can be extracted from the stem and root bark.
Nitrogen fixing: It fixes atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria which enables it to survive on infertile sites.
Ornamental: The vivid colors of its leaves, flowers and bark make A. leucophloea a beautiful, yet underutilized, ornamental tree. 
Intercropping: Interplanting A. leucophloea at low densities with crops or pasture grasses can benefit both crops and trees.
Alcohol:  The bark is used to distill liquor in India."
Acacia mangium,"Local names:
 English (sabah salwood,mangium,hickory wattle,brown salwood,black wattle), Filipino (maber), Indonesian (tongke hutan,nak,mangge hutan), Malay (mangium), Polynesia (arr), Spanish (zamorano), Thai (krathin-thepha,kra thin tepa), Trade name (brown salwood)
Acacia mangium is a single-stemmed evergreen tree or shrub that grows to 25-35 m in height. Young trees have smooth, greenish bark; fissures begin to develop at 2-3 years. Bark in older trees is rough, hard, fissured near the base, greyish-brown to dark brown, inner bark pale brown. Bole in older trees branchless for up to 15 m, fluted, up to 90 cm in diameter; branchlets acutely triangular.

Phyllodes are large up to 25 cm long and 3.5-10 cm broad, 2-5 times as long as wide, straight or straight along 1 side and curved along the other, with 4 (max. 5) main longitudinal veins, secondary veins finely anastomosing; glaborous, pulvinus 6-10 cm long. A gland (extra floral nectary) is conspicuous at the base of the phyllode.

Inflorescence is composed of many tiny white or cream flowers in spikes. Flowers are quinqeufloral; the calyx is 0.6-0.8 mm long, with obtuse lobes; corolla 1.2-1.5 mm long. Peduncles are canescent and pubescent, about 1 cm long; rachis is also canescent and pubescent.

Pods are broad, linear and irregularly coiled when ripe. They are membranous or slightly woody, inconspicuously veined. 3-5 mm wide and 7-10 cm long. Ripening pods change from green to brown, stiff and dry. Seeds are black and shiny with shape ranging from longitudinal, elliptical, ovate to oblong, 3-5 mm by 2-3 mm. The seeds are arranged longitudinally and attached to the pods by an orange to red folded funicle.

The generic name acacia comes from the Greek word ‘akis’, meaning a point or a barb.
This acacia was originally described as Mangium montanum Rumph.  in Herbarium Amboinense (1750) but changed to an Acacia in 1806. The specific name is an allusion that this tree resembled 'mangge' (mangroves in Indonesia).
Ecology

A. mangium is a species of the humid, tropical lowland zones. It tolerates pH levels between 4.5 and 6.5. It occurs behind mangroves in seasonal swamps, along streams and on well-drained flats, low ridges and mountain foothills. A. mangium occurs in the Aru Islands, Irian Jaya, Seram, the Sula Islands of Indonesia; Western Province of Papua New Guinea; and northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is sometimes found dominant in primary and secondary forest, forest margin, savannah, grassland, savanna woodland, on poorly drained floodplains and along fringes of mangrove forest, where it is sometimes associated with Melaleuca and Rhizophora species. In Papua New Guinea, it often prefers slightly higher and drier sites than other Acacia species growing in the same area. This species has been successfully planted on abandoned areas of shifting cultivation colonized by Imperata cylindrica grass, but does not tolerate waterlogging and soils derived from ultrabasic rocks.
Native range
Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea
Tree management

A. mangium grows fast; it can achieve a mean annual diameter increment of up to 5 cm and a height of up to 5 m in the 1st 4-5 years. It is reported to grow 3 m tall in the 1st year in Sabah and Sumatra, and in the Philippines it reached an average height of 8.3 m and diameter 9.4 cm after a further 2 years. However growth declines rapidly after 7 or 8 years. Except under ideal conditions or over periods of more than 20 years, the tree will probably not exceed 35 cm in diameter and 35 m in height. In Sabah, 14-year-old trees were 30 m tall and 40 cm in diameter. Provenances from Papua New Guinea consistently show better growth in height and diameter and superior form.

Optimal growth of trees is achieved most effectively if vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi such as Glomus fasciculatus and Gigaspora margarita are present in combination with Rhizobium. Technologies for the commercial production of rhizobial and VAM innoculants are now available in Southeast Asia. The ectomycorhizal fungus Thelephora ramaroides has been identified in association with A. mangium.

Acacia species are pioneers that demand full light for good development; in shade, A. mangium growth is stunted and spindly. Trees are renowned for their robustness and adaptability, which makes them good plantation species. Survival after planting out A. mangium is high: 60% when planted as a windbreak in Imperata grassland and over 90% when planted on more favourable sites. Plantation canopy cover occurs after 9 months to 3 years, depending on soil fertility, weediness and initial spacing. In Sabah in a plantation with an initial spacing of 3 x 3 m, the canopy closed in 1 year. In the 1st year, the plantation should be protected from livestock, as they browse the trees, and it should be weeded, taking particular care to remove climbers, creepers and vines. A. mangium has been found very sensitive to herbicides.

As trees have a tendency to produce multiple leaders from the base, singling is carried out at 4-6 months after planting. Persistem branches are pruned out only in plantations where the objective is to produce quality saw or veneer logs. Usually pruning is done twice; the 2nd time the branches are pruned out farther up the trunk, often to a height of 6 m. Pruning out branches with diameter of 2 cm or more makes the tree susceptible to infections, especially heart rot. Trees are very responsive to extra growing space. The thinning carried out in plantations for pulpwood production is aimed at achieving a final stock of 600-700 stems/ha from the 1 250 trees/ha planted. It is executed after 18 months. These plantations are clear felled after 6-8 years. In plantations producing quality logs, the initial number of trees is generally thinned, reducing them from 900 ha to 100-200/ha in 2 or 3 thinnings. The 1st thinning is done when trees are 9 m tall, that is, before 2 years of age. The rotation is 15-20 years. In Papua New Guinea, plantations grown on a 7-8 year rotation for pulpwood are not thinned. Trees are felled for pulpwood 6-7 years after planting; for sawn timber the rotation is 15-20 years.

The productivity of trees has been found to be closely related to ‘total’ soil potassium levels in Kalimantan (accounting for 50% of the variation in data) and phosphorus levels in Malaysia.
For the production of seedlings, the pods should be processed as soon as possible after harvesting. Pods and seeds should not be left long to dry in the sun, as temperatures exceeding 43 deg. C reduce viability. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. There is little loss in viability (6%) after 1-2 years storage at 4-5 deg. C. There are about 66 000-120 000 seed/kg.
A. mangium is a species of the humid, tropical lowland zones. It tolerates pH levels between 4.5 and 6.5. It occurs behind mangroves in seasonal swamps, along streams and on well-drained flats, low ridges and mountain foothills. A. mangium occurs in the Aru Islands, Irian Jaya, Seram, the Sula Islands of Indonesia; Western Province of Papua New Guinea; and northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is sometimes found dominant in primary and secondary forest, forest margin, savannah, grassland, savanna woodland, on poorly drained floodplains and along fringes of mangrove forest, where it is sometimes associated with Melaleuca and Rhizophora species. In Papua New Guinea, it often prefers slightly higher and drier sites than other Acacia species growing in the same area. This species has been successfully planted on abandoned areas of shifting cultivation colonized by Imperata cylindrica grass, but does not tolerate waterlogging and soils derived from ultrabasic rocks.
A. mangium can be propagated from seed (direct sowing or in the nursery) and by air-layering, cuttings, grafting and tissue culture. Propagation by seedling is best although direct sowing is also possible. Regeneration through coppicing or pollarding is poor. Seeds are pretreated before sowing by immersing them in boiling water (100 deg. C) for 30 seconds then soaking them in cold water for 24 hours; alternatively, they may be manually scarified. The germination rate is high, generally 75-90%, and germination is rapid, occurring within 1 month. Seeds may be sown in seedbeds and pricked out 6-10 days after sowing; recovery rate with this method is about 37%. Sowing in germination trays (wet towel method) and pricking out the seedlings 6-10 days after sowing when the radicle emerges gives 85% recovery. Another option is direct sowing in containers (polythene bags, open-ended hanging pots called ‘root trainers’ or other permanent pots) followed by pricking out to maintain 1 seedling per container. There are no specific requirements for the type of substrate; mixtures of topsoil, peat, old sawdust, rice husks, sand and vermiculite are used. Even a pure mixture of peat vermiculite with a pH of 3.1 presented no problems. A mixture of peat (70-80%) and rice husks (30-20%) has been used successfully in Sumatra. Nitrogen-phosphorus potassium fertilizers are generally applied in the nursery, but fertilization is stopped when ‘hardening off’ the plants by reducing watering and exposing them to full sunlight. The appropriate height for transplanting is 25-40 cm, when the seedlings have been in the nursery for 9-16 weeks. Plants can also be propagated vegetatively through single-node stem cuttings 4-5 cm long and 0.5-1.5 cm in diameter, leaving 0.5-1 phyllodes. The application of indole-butyric acid or rooting powder enables 65-75% rooting; rooting is reported to be slow. Air-layering gives promising results. Trees regenerate abundantly in clear-felled areas or where a light fire has occurred. However there is no report of a crop grown from natural regeneration.
Erosion control:  A. mangium is employed in soil conservation.
  The germinating seeds can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.
Young shoots and leaves are browsed by buffalo and cattle. Studies indicate they are high in crude protein content but with low in vitro dry matter digestibility.
With a calorific value of 4 800-4 900 kcal/kg, A. mangium provides good quality charcoal and is suitable for the manufacture of charcoal briquettes and artificial carbon.
Fibre:  The pulp is readily bleached to high brightness levels and is excellent for papermaking. The neutral sulphite semi-chemical pulping of A. mangium gives yields of 61-75%. It is currently grown primarily for pulp and paper in Sabah, Sumatra and Vietnam. Wood also makes excellent particleboard.
Timber:  A. mangium is an important source of wattle timber; the wood is used for construction, boat building, furniture and cabinet making, and veneer. It makes attractive furniture and cabinets, mouldings, and door and window components. Conversion into veneer and plywood is feasible with no specific processing requirements. It is unsuitable for timber because it contains knots and flutes, has a high incidence of rot and is subject to termite attack. Its density is (min. 450) 530-690 kg/cubic m at 15% mc.
Shade or shelter:  With its dense foliage, retained throughout the year, A. mangium makes a useful shade tree, screening and soil cover crop. It has been used experimentally in Sabah to shade cocoa. It can also be planted as a wind or firebreak.
Tannin or dyestuff:  It has high tannin content (18-39%), justifying commercial exploitation of tannins.
Nitrogen fixing:  A. mangium trees form a symbiosis with soil bacteria of the genus Rhizobium, leading to root nodules, in which the bacteria transform free nitrogen into organic and inorganic compounds containing nitrogen.
Ornamental:  In Malaysia, A. mangium is a widely planted roadside tree, and in Thailand, it is recommended for wider use in urban forestry.
Intercropping:  Experiments have shown that it has potential in some intercropping combinations, such as with maize or peanuts"
Balanites aegyptiaca,"Local names:
 Amharic (kudkuda,jemo,bedeno), Arabic (zachun,zaccone,heglig (tree),zacon,kuge,lalob  (fruit)), Bemba (katikayengele,mubambwangoma), Bengali (hin), English (soap berry tree,simple-thorned torchwood,simple thorned torch tree,Jericho balsam,lalob tree,hegl
Balanites aegyptiaca is a multibranched, spiny shrub or tree up to l0 m high. Crown rounded, dense (but still seen through) with long stout branchlets. Trunk and bark grey, deeply fissured longitudinally.

Leaves compound and spirally arranged on the shoots, dark green with 2 firm coriaceous leaflets; dimensions and shapes varying widely. Petiole canaliculate, from 5 mm to 20 mm with a short rachis. Most accounts indicate a maximum length of 8 mm for Uganda. Margin of each leaflet entire; lamina generally up to 6 cm long, 4 cm broad, although apparently smaller (1-3 x 0.3-1.5 cm) in the Sahara and in Palestine.

Inflorescence a sessile or shortly pedunculate fascicle of a few flowers. Flower buds ovoid and tomentose. Individual flowers hermaphroditic, pentamerous an actinomorphic, 8-14 mm in diameter and generally greenish-yellow. Pedicels densely greyish, pubescent and rarely reaching 10 mm in length, although 15 mm is reported for Zambia and Zimbabwe. The usual length is about 8 mm. 

Fruit ellipsoid, up to 4 cm long, green. Ripe fruit brown or pale brown with a brittle coat enclosing a brown or brown-green sticky pulp and a hard stone seed.

The name Balanites (from the Greek for acorn, referring to the fruit) was given in 1813 by Alire Delile  and replaced Agialid (derived from the Arabic name for the tree, 'heglig').
Ecology

B. aegyptiaca has wide ecological distribution; however, it reaches its maximum development as an individual tree on low-lying, level alluvial sites with deep sandy loam and uninterrupted access to water such as valley floors, riverbanks or the foot of rocky slopes. It is intolerant to shade after the seedling stage and therefore prefers open woodland or savannah for natural regeneration.
Native range
Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Israel, Kenya, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Republic of, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Coppices and pollards well and can regenerate after lopping and heavy browsing. Where fruit is the principal interest, pollarding and coppicing for obtaining fodder are seldom employed.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for 2 years in air-dry storage at cool temperatures or for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 6-10% mc. One kilogram of cleaned, extracted seeds, air-dried to 15% mc, contains 500-1500 seeds.
B. aegyptiaca has wide ecological distribution; however, it reaches its maximum development as an individual tree on low-lying, level alluvial sites with deep sandy loam and uninterrupted access to water such as valley floors, riverbanks or the foot of rocky slopes. It is intolerant to shade after the seedling stage and therefore prefers open woodland or savannah for natural regeneration.
Seeds may be collected from fruit that is being processed for other purposes, from dung, and directly from the trees. Soaking in water for some hours and then stirring vigorously separates the stones from the pulp. Seed germination can be improved by immersing the seeds in boiling water for 7-10 min then cooling slowly. The effect that passage through an animal’s intestinal tract has on germination is unclear. However, seeds are said to germinate readily, although with some difference associated with date of collection.

Natural regeneration is primarily through seeding. The fruit is high in demand, which gives it high economic value; therefore, little fruit and thus few seeds are left for natural regeneration of the species. The tree also can generate by coppice shoots and its abundant root suckers.
Poison:  An emulsion made from the fruit or bark is lethal to the freshwater snails that are the host of miracidia and cercaria stages of bilharzia and to a water flea that acts as a host to the guinea worm. A fish poison can be obtained from the fruit, root and the bark. The active agent of the poison is saponin. The compound is toxic to fish but does not affect mammals and rapidly becomes inert, so that fish retrieved are edible. However, in the Fada region of Cote d’Ivoire, the poison is reported to damage the sight of fishermen after they have used it for 5-6 years.
  The fleshy pulp of both unripe and ripe fruit is edible and eaten dried or fresh. The fruit is processed into a drink and sweetmeats in Ghana, an alcoholic liquor in Nigeria, a soup ingredient in Sudan. Young leaves and tender shoots are used as a vegetable, which is boiled, pounded, then fried or fat added to prepare it. The flowers are a supplementary food in West Africa and an ingredient of ‘dawa dawa’ flavouring in Nigeria. Flowers are sucked to obtain nectar.
Fodder: The fresh and dried leaves, fruit and sprouts are all eaten by livestock. As shown in an experiment in Burkina Faso, B. aegyptiaca contributed up to 38% of the dry-matter intake of goats in the dry season. Kernel meal, the residue remaining after oil extraction, is widely used in Senegal, Sudan and Uganda as a stock feed. The tree is lopped for fodder in India (Maharashta, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan).
The wood is good firewood; it produces considerable heat and very little smoke, making it particularly suitable for indoor use. It produces high-quality charcoal, and it has been suggested that the nutshell is suitable for industrial activated charcoal. The calorific value is estimated at 4600 kcal/kg.
Fibre:  A strong fibre is obtained from the bark.
Timber:  The wood is pale yellow or yellowish-brown. Heartwood and sapwood are not clearly differentiated. The wood is hard, durable, worked easily and made into yokes, wooden spoons, pestles, mortars, handles, stools and combs. It shows no serious seasoning defects and no tendency towards surface checking or splitting. The wood saws cleanly and easily, planes without difficulty to a smooth finish and is easy to chisel. It glues firmly and takes a clear varnish. The timber has traditionally been a minor product. The usually small log size and the prevalence of stem fluting makes sawmill processing difficult.
Shade or shelter:  The usually evergreen behaviour potentially makes B. aegyptiaca an attractive element to introduce into shelterbelts, although because of its slow growth, it is not suitable as a principal species.
Lipids:  The kernels produce edible oil used for cooking. The oil remains stable when heated and has a high smoking point, and therefore its free fatty acid content is low. Its scent and taste are acceptable.
Medicine:  Decoction of root is used to treat malaria. Roots boiled in soup are used against oedema and stomach pains. Roots are used as an emetic; bark infusion is used to treat heartburn. Wood gum mixed with maize meal porridge is used to treat chest pains. The bark is used to deworm cattle in Rajasthan.
Gum or resin:  A greenish-yellow to orange-red resin is produced from the stems. It is sucked and chewed when fresh. It is used as a glue for sticking feathers onto arrow shafts and spearheads and in the repair of handle cracks and arrows.
As a thorny tree, B. aegyptiaca is useful for fencing. Boundary and amenity plantings are widespread in Africa. Cut branches are used to make livestock enclosures.
Alcohol: The fruit of B. aegyptiaca may be used to brew an alcoholic drink"
Barringtonia procera,"Local names:
 English (cutnut), Pidgin English (katanat)
Cutnut is a medium-size fast growing, evergreen tree up to 24 m high but often range between 8-12 m with a crown diameter of 0.8–6 m and mature tree dbh of 2-45 cm. 
Cutnut produces a vigorous framework of branches following the formation of the terminal inflorescences.

Leaves large, simple, lanceolate and arranged in a whorl at each node. Leaf size varies, typically measuring 21.5–66 cm long and 5–20 cm wide. The upper surface of the leaf is dark green and glossy; the lower surface is slightly paler. Typically, the leaf has a truncated base and an acuminated apex, with undulated margins. 

Inflorescence racemose with a 30–110 cm long pendulous spike containing up to 150 densely packed flower buds, arranged in spirally alternate pattern, and varying in colors, typically from green to white or red.  Flowering is terminal on the shoots. Flower buds are semisessile to sessile and are protected by a calyx closed in the bud, which ruptures into two to four pseudolobes. 

Fruits multiple, sessile, elongated, oblong to obovoid, tapering toward the apex and base, and borne on a pendulous rachis. At maturity they are indehiscent, but the skin can be easily peeled off when ripe. Length of a mature fruit varies between 25–95 mm. 

Seed or kernel is contained in a fibrous, white to purplish, cylindrical, eight-sided endocarp shell (prominent when exocarp and mesocarp are removed). 

Bark smooth at early stages of growth but becomes fissured as the trees grow older. Large lenticels up to 5 mm across are present.

The tree has a relatively shallow taproot and a well formed network of lateral roots, concentrated in the topsoil layer.
Ecology

Common in old gardens, mature coconut plantations, and coastal villages, and in remnants of secondary lowland humid tropical rainforests.  Within its natural range are other species including canarium nut (Canarium spp.), breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), coconut (Cocos nucifera), Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer), poumuli (Flueggea flexuosa), sago palm (Metroxylon salomonense), Malay apple (Syzygium malaccense), Mangifera minor, Ficus spp., Macaranga spp.,Terminalia spp., and tava (Pometia pinnata).

Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu
Tree management

Cutnut is naturally self-pruning of lower branches up to about one-fifth of the height of the tree. Trees coppice and pollarded trees re-sprout well. 

In a small-scale plantation, seedlings should be planted at 5 x 5 m spacing, or 400 trees/ha.  In agroforestry systems mixed with other species, 40 trees/ha are optimal.  For silvopasture, a low planting density of 10-15 trees/ha is recommended to avoid shading of the pasture grass.  Seedlings may be planted on cleared land or as line-plantings in secondary forests, in which selective thinning of the forest allows more light to reach the seedlings. 

Weeding is crucial for the first 2-3 years of growth in the field. As the trees mature, weeding operations should be scaled down to cleaning once a year (largely by removing vines from the trees).

Trees that are too tall should be pollarded to reduce height and ensure safety around villages.

Note:  There is no record of cutnut becoming invasive, and in situ observation on the distribution of wildings appears to rule out any potential invasiveness.
Well formed, ripe fruits should be collected from the ground, fresh fruits collected from the tree result in low germination if immature.  Fruit maturity is indicated by a distinctive dieback of the persistent stigma at the base of the fruit.

Seeds are recalcitrant, do not withstand drying, and remain viable only for short period in dry storage. To maximize storage, it is best to retain the mesocarp on the nut and store the seeds in a shady, cool (19-25°C), and low-humidity environment and out of reach of pests such as crabs and rodents.

There is no special pre-planting treatment for cutnut. Viability can be tested by placing them in water. Fruits that float are likely to be non-viable.
Common in old gardens, mature coconut plantations, and coastal villages, and in remnants of secondary lowland humid tropical rainforests.  Within its natural range are other species including canarium nut (Canarium spp.), breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), coconut (Cocos nucifera), Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer), poumuli (Flueggea flexuosa), sago palm (Metroxylon salomonense), Malay apple (Syzygium malaccense), Mangifera minor, Ficus spp., Macaranga spp.,Terminalia spp., and tava (Pometia pinnata).
The most common method of propagating cutnut is by direct sowing or raising the seedlings in the nursery before transplanting. Vegetative propagation through marcotting and stem cuttings is also successful. Juvenile cuttings set in a non-mist propagator can give 100% rooting in three weeks, while 100% of marcotts root in 4 weeks.

Seeds should not be exposed to full sunlight and should be sown 3-5 cm (1.2-2 in) deep in a vertical position with the basal end down. Seeds from ripe fruits will start to germinate after 7 days. It takes 2-3 months to germinate a ripe fruit. 

Wildings (volunteer seedlings) can be easily transplanted, and can be stored in a shaded and cool location for up to 2-3 weeks if the seed (nut-in-shell) is left attached.
Erosion control:  The tree is rated high (more than 60% of farmers interviewed in Kolombangara, Solomon Islands) for soil stabilization due to a good network of lateral roots.
  The fruit kernel is edible, tasty, and highly nutritious and is eaten as a snack or prepared into dishes for a main meal.  It can be roasted and baked into puddings together with edible hibiscus (Abelmoschus manihot) and coconut cream.  It contains protein and carbohydrate at about 10% and 25%, respectively, in its raw form.  The mesocarp of a ripe fruit is aromatic and has potential for flavoring.
The kernel and mesocarp are a good feed for free-range chickens. Birds (cockatoos, parrots) and flying foxes feed on the fleshy mesocarp of fruits and on the flower nectar. The fallen kernels and mesocarps are food to some freshwater fish and prawns.
Apiculture:  The tree is a good bee forage for nectar.
Fallen branches and felled trees make good firewood.
Timber:  Despite its poor quality, the wood is used for crafts and temporary light construction. The wood is sometimes used for making paddles in the Reef Islands, Temotu Province, Solomon Islands.
Shade or shelter:  In a homegarden situation, cutnut provides good shade and shelter to cereal and other understory crops such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and edible hibiscus (Abelmoschus manihot). With appropriate spacing, the tree can provide m
Medicine:  Leaves and bark are largely used medicinally.  The leaves have been used to treat inflammation of the ear and headaches. Sap from the bark has been used for treating ciguatera poisoning, coughs, and urinary infections, and the red-leafed form is used as a contraceptive and for abortion.
Ornamental:  Cutnut is an attractive evergreen tree with bright flowers that beautifies rural villages. Being a medium-size tree and providing good shade, it would be suitable as a park or street tree. Its pendulous flowers and fruits are attractive in an urban landscape.
Cutnut tree can be used as support for fencing.  In its native areas, cutnut indicates human settlements and provides proof of land ownership, and therefore can serve as a good boundary marker.  The tree is a good medium-he
Soil improver:  Fallen leaves, flowers, and dead branches enrich the surrounding soil.
Intercropping:  Its open canopy structure allows sufficient light penetration to the ground level for other crops to be interplanted under it.  It is compatible with common field crops such as cabbage, sweet potato, banana, Xanthosoma spp., and cassava.  Farmers in Temotu province of the Solomon Islands have used cutnut as a companion and interline tree crop in an improved traditional agroforestry system. It is a good trellis tree for betel nut vine (Piper betle).
Essential oils:  The kernel oil has potential for cooking and body care products."
Barringtonia racemosa,"Local names:

Barringtonia racemosa is usually a small tree, 4-8 m in height but occasionally reaching 15 m; bark grey, yellow or brown, mottled, rather smooth to fissured; no aboveground roots but may have spreading surface roots.

Leaves alternate, simple, crowded at the ends of the branches, large, obovate-oblong to oblanceolate, 8-35 x 4-13 cm; apex deep green, broadly tapering; base narrowly tapering, running into the petiole; margin entire or very shallowly toothed or scalloped; petiole very short, without hairs.

Flowers attractive, white to pale pink, in many-flowered pendulous sprays; up to 60 cm in length or even more; bisexual; all floral parts in 4s; sepals joined at the base, separating in 3-4 lobes, green flushed with pink, about 10 x 7.5 mm; petal elliptic, up to 3 x 1 cm, attached to the staminal tube; stamens many, long, white or pinkish, forming a large central mass 3.5 cm in diameter; ovary 2 to 4 chambered; style red.

Fruit conical to ovate, about 3 x 2 cm, crowned by the remains of the persistent calyx; style fleshy at first, later becoming hard, fibrous and yellowish-brown when mature. Seeds aromatic.

The genus is named after the Hon. Daines Barrington, 1727-1800, an English nobleman, lawyer, antiquary and naturalist who wrote a book on English trees. The specific name ‘racemosa’ means ‘having racemes’; a raceme being a string-like arrangement of stalked flowers.
Ecology

B. racemosa, which is considered a mangrove associate, can also be found in tropical rainforest areas, open lowlands and thickets. Occurring always near water: along riverbanks and in freshwater swamps, and occasionally in the less saline areas of mangrove swamps, where it may develop pneumatophores. The species cannot tolerate even light frost. It favours the wet tropical, moist topical and wet subtropical climatic zones. It is distributed from eastern Africa and Madagascar to Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, southern China, Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands (Japan), Thailand, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India), throughout the Malesian region towards Micronesia, Polynesia (east to Fiji and Samoa) and northern Australia.

B. racemosa can be propagated by seed or by cuttings. Seedling have hypogeal germination.
Poison:  Seeds of the species contain saponins, which are used as a fish poison; the whole fruit, bark, wood and root can be used. Extracts of the plant have proved effective against Citrus aphis; in Bengal the seed is used as an insecticide, and to poison people; coconut is said to be the antidote.
 Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable; seeds are pounded to extract the starchy content, which is made into cakes.
Provides suitable firewood.
Fibre:  It has been applied in various kinds of wood-based panels such as hardboard, particleboard and blockboard, and has been used for the production of pulp. In Kenya, the bark is utilized as cordage. 
Timber:  B. racemosa yields a medium-weight hardwood with a density of 480-815 kg/m³ at 15% mc. Heartwood is pale yellow-brown, sometimes with reddish tinge, not differentiated from the sapwood; grain is straight to interlocked; texture moderately fine and even. The wood is not durable; sapwood is permeable, heartwood moderately resistant to pressure impregnation. The wood is light and soft and is used for light work that does not require great strength. Utilized for temporary construction, local house building (posts and beams), general planking, flooring, boat building, mouldings, interior finish, handles of non-striking tools, household utensils, agricultural implements, boxes and crates and wooden pallets. It is suitable for veneer and plywood manufacturing. In India, it is used additionally for carts, rice pounders and cabinetwork. In the Philippines, it has been reported that when treated with preservatives, the timber can be used to make good ties and paving blocks. In the Pacific region, the wood has additionally been used for carving and turnery. 
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark yields tannin.
Medicine:  Root, bark and juice are used medicinally in the East; the Zulu tribe of South Africa uses the fruit to remedy malaria. The fruit is used to treat cough, asthma and diarrhoea; pulverized fruit is used as snuff. Seeds are used to treat eye inflammation and by midwives for parturition. In Malaysia, the leaves traditionally are used to treat high blood pressure and as a depurative. Pounded leaves are said to treat chicken pox.

Bauhinia purpurea is a small to medium-sized deciduous fast-growing shrub or tree with a round, symmetrical, moderate dense crown to 10 m tall, young branches becoming glabrous or nearly so (glabrescent). In dry forests, the size is much smaller. The bark is pale grey brown, fairly smooth to slightly fissured and scaly. The twigs are slender, light green, slightly hairy, and angled, becoming brownish grey. The heart-wood is brown, hard and durable.

Leaves simple, alternate, base rounded to shallow-cordate, up to 12 cm x 12 cm, deeply 2-lobed at apex up to 1/3-1/2, ca. 7-12 cm long, and equally wide, margin entire and the surfaces smooth and glabrous, and 9- or 11-nerved at base, the apex lobes rounded or obtuse to subacute, minute stipules 1-2 mm long, petioles puberulous to glabrous, 2.5-3.5 cm long; leaf blades 4.5-11 cm long. 

Inflorescence a 6-10-flowered raceme in terminal panicles; flowers numerous, hypanthium, turbinate, purple to nearly white or at least purple-marked, the flower buds clavate (club-shaped), velvety, ca 3-4 cm long prior to anthesis; fertile stamens 3 or 4, the anthers ca 6 mm long, versatile; ovary superior; corolla of 5 narrow petals and constricted at base, oblanceolate, 3-5cm long, claws 5-10mm long, the banner purple-striate, ca 7 mm wide; calyx tubular, erupted by corolla along one side when flower fully expanding; calyx split into 2 valves with 5 teeth. In fall, before the leaves drop, Orchid-Tree is festooned with many showy and delightfully fragrant, five-inch-wide blossoms, the narrow purple, pink, and lavender petals arranged to closely resemble an orchid. These flowers appear on the trees from September through November and are a beautiful sight to see, creating a vivid splash of color in the autumn landscape. The flowers are followed by 12-inch-long, slender, brown, flat seed pods which usually persist on the tree throughout the winter.

Fruit brown, strap-shaped, not septate, elongated dehiscent pods, ca. 15-30 cm long, up to 1.5-2.5 cm wide, containing 10-15- shiny-brown, glabrous, dehiscent, rounded, flat seeds; twists as opens. Seed forms very rapidly and trees in flower may already show numerous green pods. While most pods will open in the drier winter weather some may persist through to the next flowering season. Fruit maturing in spring and summer. Fruit does not attract wildlife.

Seeds orbicular, 13-16mm in diameter, 1-2mm thick.

The generic name commemorates the Bauhin brothers Jean (1541-1613) and Gaspard (1560-1624), Swiss botanists. The two lobes of the leaf exemplify the two brothers. The specific name refers to the purple colour of the flowers.

There are about 300 species of this genus found in tropical regions. The genus includes trees, vines, and shrubs that are frequently planted for their showy flowers and ornamental foliage. There is a presence of stomata on the seeds and pods.
Ecology

B. purpurea is a plant of tropical and subtropical climates usually found in most types of vegetation ranging from evergreen lowland rain forest to mountain forest and savanna, scrub and dry deciduous forest to swamp foreston various soils. It occurs at lower elevations especially frequent along the valleys in its native habitat. It demands plenty of light and requires good drainage. Severe frost kills the leaves of seedlings and saplings, but they recover during summer. The species is frost-hardy but least drought-hardy compared to other species of Bauhinia. The tree actually flower best on dry soils.

Tree management

B. purpurea should be grown in full sun on well-drained soil. For successful establishment of Bauhinia, protection from grazing or browsing for the first 2-3 years is necessary, because the young saplings are much relished by animals. In regular plantations, the trees should be kept adequately thinned as they grow. The tree may need occasional pruning to develop a uniform shape when it is young. Growth rate is relatively good in lower altitudes but above 1600m, growth is very slow and plantation scarcely justified. The tree coppices well and can stand heavy lopping fairly well. It has been cultivated sporadically, generally in and around cultivation and habitations, or in mixed forests or avenue plantations, no systematic block plantations have been established. Branches tend to develop low on the trunk and droop toward the ground forming a large bush if left unpruned. The species has a tendency to show nutritional deficiencies, especially potassium. Trees are frost- and drought-tolerant and flower best on dry soils. The species is reported weedy in gardens in Hawaii.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability maintained for 3 years in hermetic storage at room temperature. There are 4000-5000 seeds/kg. About 600 to 1900 plants are raised per Kg of seed.

Severe frost kills the leaves of seedlings and saplings, but they recover during summer. The species is frost-hardy but least drought-hardy compared to other species of Bauhinia. The tree actually flower best on dry soils.
Propagation is by seeds, grafting, cuttings, and air-layerings and is reported in many countries especially in southeast Asia. Bauhinia reproduces itself naturally from seeds, as pods open on the trees during hot season, scattering the seeds which germinate with the start of the rains. Regeneration is sometimes plentiful in fresh soil deposits on landslips under seed-bearers but in most cases is scanty because birds and insects destroy most of the seed lying exposed on the ground. Bauhinias should preferably be grown in full sun in fertile, moisture-retentive but well-drained soils.

Artificial propagation is through direct sowing and stump planting. Seeds give a good germination rate of 85-95%, beginning 5-10 days after sowing and is completed 1-2 weeks later.  Both methods are quite successful and considered better than planting out 1-year-old seedlings. Branch cuttings root only with difficulty but cuttings of semi-ripe wood with leaves removed will root in moist sand root well.
Erosion control:  Bauhinia purpurea with a deep root system and high root: shoot ratio may be a suitable species for slope stabilization.
  The young leaves and flowers of various Bauhinia species are eaten as a side dish with rice, or used to flavour meat and fish.  Sometimes the seeds are edible.
In an experiment in Nepal, B.purpurea was found increase milk production in lactating buffaloes. Leaves make good fodder and are greedily eaten by sheep, goats and cattle with protein content estimated at 12.6%.
Used as fuelwood; its calorific value is 4 800 kcal/kg.
Fibre: The bark of bauhinia is used to make rope and stems of smaller lianescent species are used for binding.  Some bauhinia species are used for binding.  Some bauhinia species reputed for their fibre application are used medicinally as well.
Timber: The wood is used for agricultural implements.
Tannin or dyestuff: The bark of various bauhinia species contains considerable amounts of tanninwidely used in leather industry in India. Medicinal uses of bark can be largely attributed to the presence of these tannins.  Flavonoids are a common feature of Bauhinia.
Lipids: The seeds contain high amounts of linolenic and oleic fatty acids (15% of a non-drying oil) and low amounts of myristic and linolenic fatty acids.
Medicine: Throughout South-East Asia various parts of numerous Bauhinia species are used in poulticing to reduce swelling and bruises, and to ripen ulcerations and boils.  Decoctions of various plant parts are taken internally as a febrifugal, antidiarrhoeal and antidysenteric remedy and also it is used as an astringent.  In India, the bark is extensively applied in glandular diseases and as a poison antidote while the leaves are administered as cough medicine. The flowers are said to be laxative and used in curries and pickles.
Gum or resin: The tree yield edible gum. 
Ornamental:  B. purpurea is widely planted as an ornamental tree in parks, gardens and homesteads, and along avenues for its showy fragrant, purple flowers. The weak wood is susceptible to breakage in storms; the abundant seedlings, which may germinate in the landscape; and the litter problem, created by the falling leaves, flowers, and seedpods."
Bauhinia rufescens,"Local names:
 Arabic (kulkul,kharoub), Fula (nammare), Hausa (matsagi,jirga,jiga), Wolof (randa)
Bauhinia rufescens is a shrub or small tree usually 1-3 m high, sometimes reaching 8 m; bark ash-grey, smooth, very fibrous and scaly when old; slash pink; twigs arranged in 1 plane like a fishbone, with thornlike, lignified, lateral shoots, 10 cm long.

Leaves very small, bilobate almost to the base, with semi-circular lobes, glabrous, with long petioles, greyish-green, less than 3 cm long.

Flowers greenish-yellow to white and pale pink, in few-flowered racemes; petals 5, spathulate, 15-20 mm long; stamens 10, filaments hairy at the base.

Fruits aggregated, long, narrow pods, twisted, up to 10 cm long, glabrous, obliquely constricted, shining dark red-brown, with 4-10 seeds each. Pods remain on the shrub for a long time.

The generic name commemorates Swiss botanists Jean (1541-1613) and Gaspard (1560-1624) Bauhin. The 2 lobes of the leaf exemplify the 2 brothers; ‘rufescens’ means ‘becoming reddish’.
Ecology

B. rufescens is deciduous in drier areas and is an evergreen in wetter areas. It is often found in dry savannah, especially near stream banks. It is found in the entire Sahel and adjacent Sudan zone, from Senegal and Mauritania across North Ghana and Niger to central Sudan and Ethiopia.
Native range
Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda
Tree management

Seedlings are fairly hardy but need to be protected from browsing animals for at least 1 season. Growth is fairly slow, with a height of 1 m expected after 2 years where annual rainfall is 500 mm. If the tree is to be established in clay soils, some form of micro-catchment is recommended. There is not much experience in managing this species as yet, but it should be researched regarding production of forage. Bauhinia regenerates quickly and abundantly after browsing.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; no loss in viability during 1 year in hermetic storage at 4 deg. C. There are approximately 9000-10 000 seeds/kg.
B. rufescens is deciduous in drier areas and is an evergreen in wetter areas. It is often found in dry savannah, especially near stream banks. It is found in the entire Sahel and adjacent Sudan zone, from Senegal and Mauritania across North Ghana and Niger to central Sudan and Ethiopia.
The species is scarcely propagated and grows mainly in the wild. Seeds require pretreatment before planting in the nursery. The recommended treatment involves boiling seeds for several minutes and allowing them to cool. This gives a germination percentage of about 40%. The length of time required in the nursery is 4-6 months.

Good rooting has been observed on cuttings, with 85% producing roots in 2 weeks. The cuttings rooted better in a sand or a sand-gravel mixture, and upper nodes rooted better than basal nodes.
Erosion control:  Planting B. rufescens in dunes can help stabilize and control them.
  In Ghana, farmers, hunters and field workers eat the wild fruits.
The green and dried fruit and the leaves and shoots are valuable forage, favoured by many species of wild and domestic animals, which may cause the extinction of B. rufescens in regions overstocked with livestock. In Sudan, the pods are said to be the most valuable forage for camels. The nutritive value of the pods is characterized by crude protein 13.5% dry matter (DM), net energy 5.4 mJ/kg of DM, digestible protein/FU 0.19, and digestible DM (leaves) 51%.
The wood makes acceptable firewood and good charcoal.
Fibre: The crude bark is used for binding. The bast fibre serves as a plaiting and binding material, and in Sudan the fibre is extracted for cordage.
Timber:  The light-brown, fine-grained wood can be used for carpentry, joinery and wood-carving if sizes sufficiently large are available; otherwise it is used as stakes and fence poles.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark contains tannin and is locally used for tanning hides.
Medicine:  An extract of the root is used as an astringent or antipyretic in local medicine. Leaves and fruit are applied for the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery and ophthalmic diseases. The bark of the roots and trunk is used to cure chest complaints, syphilis and other venereal diseases, leprosy, diarrhoea and dysentery and to reduce fever.
Ornamental:  The tree is sometimes planted as an ornamental. It is suitable for roadsides, and it may easily be grown indoors provided the conditions are warm and brightly lit.
B. rufescens provides a good, impenetrable, browse-resistant live fence; useful for protecting gardens, fields and compounds."
Bauhinia tomentosa,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (bosbeesklou), Cantonese (kanchivala), English (variegated bauhinia,St. Thomas tree,bell bauhinia,orchid tree,hairy bauhinia,mountain ebony,yellow tree bauhinia), Hindi (kural,gurial,padrian,gwiar,kachnar,koliar), Malay (akbar tapak kerbau,kupu
Bauhinia tomentosa is usually a scrambling, many-stemmed shrub or small tree reaching 4 m (max. 8) in height, the branches often drooping, with many slender twigs. Bark grey and smooth or slightly hairy on young branches, becoming brown and smooth on the older stems.

Leaves deeply divided for almost half their length, with a small apical appendage between the lobes; each lobe is oval to almost elliptic, most often small about 2.5 x 2.5 cm, but may be up to 8 cm, pale fresh green; apex of each lobe broadly tapering; base of the whole leaf shallowly lobed; margin entire, petiolate; leaf stalk 10 to 30 mm long.

Flowers bell-shaped, up to 7 cm long, beautiful and distinctive, pendulous, solitary, with large, lemon-yellow petals, 1-3 of which have a dark maroon patch at the base and turning a veined reddish brown with age.

Fruit a woody pod, slender, pale brown, velvety, pointed, 10-11 x 1.5-2 cm, dehiscent, splitting on the tree to release 6-12 seeds. Seeds 7-8.5 x 5.5-7 x 2-3 mm, ovate, compressed, glossy, reddish brown, somewhat rugose to nearly smooth, with V-shaped marginal hilum, often bearing an apical, hook-shaped funicular remnant.

The generic name commemorates the Bauhin brothers Jean (1541-1613) and Gaspard (1560-1624), the Swiss botanists; the two lobes of the leaf exemplify the two brothers, and tomentosa is derived from tomentose, meaning with dense, interwoven hairs.
Ecology

The hairy bauhinia grows from Natal and Zululand to eastern Transvaal, northwards to tropical Africa, and eastwards to Sri Lanka and India. In South Africa, it grows in forest, bushveld and the coastal dune bush. It also occurs in low-altitude woodland, often forming part of the riverine thickets, and on the forest edges. In Zambia, it grows in thickets and on stream banks and rocky slopes of the central and southern provinces and the Luangwa Valley. Trees can be found growing naturally from Ethiopia in the north to KwaZulu Natal in the south. Trees grow in the shade or in full sun, can withstand light frost and are somewhat drought hardy.
Native range
Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Trees are fast growing, up to 900 mm a year. Flowering can be stimulated by pruning the plants once a year during the winter. For planting in dry areas, it is advisable to obtain seeds from plants growing in dry areas.
Storage behaviour of seeds is orthodox; short-term storage.

B. tomentosa is easily cultivated from seed. The seed should be immersed in hot water and soaked overnight. The soaked, swollen seeds are then planted directly into black nursery bags filled with a mixture of river sand and compost (5:1). If sown in flat seedling trays, the seedlings must be planted out into bags at an early stage as they soon develop a long taproot. Germination is usually within 7-15 days, and the young plants grow fast and transplant with no problems.
Not an important browsing tree for cattle as it contains prussic acid in the pods and the flowers; goats tend to nibble the leaves but do not consume much. Leaves are browsed by the black rhino, kudu and grey duiker; the flower buds and mature flowers are consumed by the grey lourie.
Fibre:  Trees yield a fibre suitable for making baskets.
Timber:  The wood makes rafters for huts.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Leaves are used to manufacture a yellow dye.
Medicine: The dried leaf and flower bud of B. tomentosa and a decoction of the root and bark are used medicinally by the African doctors of South Africa. In India and Sri Lanka, the root bark is used internally for conditions of the large intestine, while the flower is used as a remedy for dysentery and diarrhoea. A decoction of the root bark is used in India as a vermifuge and an infusion of the stem bark as an astringent gargle. The fruit is said to be diuretic, and the seed is eaten in India as a tonic and aphrodisiac. In Madura, the leaf is an ingredient in a plaster applied to abscesses. A decoction of the root bark is used as a vermifuge, and an infusion made from the stem bark is used as an astringent gargle. A decoction of the root bark is used for abdominal troubles and as an anthelmintic. An infusion of the root bark is used as an external application to inflamed glands, abscesses and skin conditions, while the fruit is said to be diuretic and an infusion of the rind is used as an astringent gargle. A paste of the seed made with vinegar is used as a local application to the wounds produced by venomous animals.
Ornamental:  The attractive tree is ideal for small gardens, and since the root is not aggressive, it can be planted close to a swimming pool or paving.
B. tomentosa can be effectively used as a hedge or a screen plant between camps, along fences or between blocks of various crops, for example, in tomato lands."
Bauhinia variegata,"Local names:
 Bengali (swet-kanchan,rakta-kanchan,rakta-kamhar), Cantonese (kanchivala), English (orchid tree,camel's foot,mountain ebony,Napoleon's hat,paper mulberry,poor man's orchid,bauhinia), Hindi (bogakatra,koliar,raktha-kanchan,mandari,kural,gurial,gwiar,kachn
Bauhinia variegata is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with a short bole and spreading crown, attaining a height of up to 15 m and diameter of 50 cm. In dry forests, the size is much smaller. The bark is light brownish grey, smooth to slightly fissured and scaly. Inner bark is pinkish, fibrous and bitter. The twigs are slender, zigzag; when young, light green, slightly hairy, and angled, becoming brownish grey.

Leaves have minute stipules 1-2 mm, early caducous; petiole puberulous to glabrous, 3-4 cm; lamina broadly ovate to circular, often broader than long, 6-16 cm diameter; 11-13 nerved; tips of lobes broadly rounded, base cordate; upper surface glabrous, lower glaucous but glabrous when fully grown.

Flower clusters (racemes) are unbranched at ends of twigs. The few flowers have short, stout stalks and a stalklike, green, narrow basal tube (hypanthium). The light green, fairly hairy calyx forms a pointed 5-angled bud and splits open on 1 side, remaining attached; petals 5, slightly unequal, wavy margined and narrowed to the base; 5 curved stamens; very slender, stalked, curved pistil, with narrow, green, 1-celled ovary, style and dotlike stigma.

Pods dehiscent, strap-shaped, obliquely striate, 20-30 by 2-25 cm; long, hard, flat with 10-15 seeds in each; seeds brown, flat, nearly circular with coriaceus testa.

The generic name commemorates the Bauhin brothers Jean (1541-1613) and Gaspard (1560-1624), Swiss botanists. The two lobes of the leaf exemplify the two brothers. The specific name refers to the variegation of the flowers.
Ecology

B. variegata is a plant of tropical and subtropical climates with hot, dry summers and mild winters. It demands plenty of light and requires good drainage. Severe frost kills the leaves of seedlings and saplings, but they recover during summer. The tree is fairly resistant to drought but susceptible to fires.
Native range
China, Colombia, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Direct-sown lines need to be thinned to about 1 m spacing at the end of 1st year. In regular plantations, the trees should be kept adequately thinned as they grow. The tree coppices well and can stand heavy lopping fairly well. Because B. variegata has been cultivated sporadically, generally in and around cultivation and habitations, or in mixed forests or avenue plantations, no systematic block plantations have been established. It has therefore been treated according to the objectives in view, so applicable management practices have not been evolved.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; no loss in viability in hermetic storage at room temperature for at least 2 years; viability maintained for more than 3 years in hermetic storage at room temperature with 13 ± 2% mc. Seeds stored in tins give germination rates of up to 95% after a few months of storage. There are 2 800-3 500 seeds/kg.

Artificial propagation is through direct sowing and stump planting. Both methods are quite successful and considered better than planting out 1-year-old seedlings. Branch cuttings root only with difficulty. Soaking seeds in water at room temperature for 24 hours improves germination to about 95%.
  The leaves, flowers and flower buds are eaten as vegetables.
Leaves make good fodder and are greedily eaten by sheep, goats and cattle. The average annual fodder yield per tree is 15-20 kg of dry matter.
Apiculture: It blooms in early winter and spring in India. The buds being consumed as a vegetable, bees have little chance of taking proper advantage of the bloom.
One of the main uses of B. variegata is as fuel; calorific value is 4 800 kcal/kg.
Fibre:  The bark yields a suitable fibre.
Timber:  The wood is brown and moderately hard and used for agricultural implements.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark produces tannins, used in various shades of brown.
Lipids:  The seeds are made up of 20% endocarp and 80% kernel. They yield 16.5% of a pale yellow, fatty oil on extraction with petroleum ether but only 6.1% in an hydraulic press.
Medicine:  The bark decoction is used for diarrhoea control, as an astringent alternative and for treating scrofula, skin diseases and ulcers.
Gum or resin:  The tree yields a gum.
Ornamental:  The showy fragrant, pink, purple or white flowers make the tree attractive for an ornamental and for avenue plantings."
Berchemia discolor,"Local names:

Berchemia discolor is a shrub or a tree 3-20 m high; with a straight bole; rough, dark grey bark that flakes longitudinally; dense, rounded crown; slash yellow; young branches conspicuously lenticellate; branchlets glabrous to densely pubescent with short, spreading, whitish hairs.

Leaves alternate or sub-opposite, entirely or obscurely crenate, shiny above, dull and glaucous below, broadly elliptic, ovate or obovate-elliptic-lanceolate, 2-9 x 2-5 cm, obtuse or acute at the apex, rounded or cuneate at the base; leaf stalks glabrous or pubescent, 1-1.8 cm long.

Flowers small, solitary, thick, oblong or ellipsoid, 4-5 mm in diameter, greenish when young, turning yellowish after ripening.

Fruit datelike, yellow, up to 20 x 8 mm with 1-2 flat seeds in sweet, edible flesh.

‘Berchemia’ is named after M. Berchem, a French botanist, and ‘discolor’ means with 2 or more colours, referring to the fact that the upper and the lower surfaces are different colours. ‘Dis’ is a Latin prefix meaning ‘2’.
Ecology

B. discolor grows naturally in various climates, from semi-arid areas to areas receiving rainfall in 4 years out of 5. It is found scattered in semi-desert grassland, open woodland or at lower altitudes along river valleys, especially on termite mounds. It is common in riverine forests, Acacia-Commiphora-Balanites woodland and wooded grassland, Acacia woodland and bushland, and the miombo woodlands of Tanzania. B. discolor tolerates drought but is not resistant to frost or cold wind.

Tree management

Plant groups of trees in protected areas in well-drained soil. B. discolor is a good tree to plant at or near watering points, as its roots are not aggressive. The growth rate is relatively fast, 600-800 mm/year. The tree is often found growing naturally near fertile termite mounds, so applying fertilizer at the time of planting may be useful. Tending the crop should include regular watering, slashing and spot weeding until the plants are well established. Coppicing, pollarding and lopping are all practised.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 7-13% mc. There are about 3000-3500 seeds/kg.

B. discolor tolerates drought but is not resistant to frost or cold wind.
Although rarely, B. discolor can regenerate naturally from seed, coppice or root suckers. Coppice shoots are produced on felled trees, and root suckers after root wounding. It is thought that poor seed germination capacity and destruction of seedlings and saplings by forest fires may be the cause of B. discolor's apparent rare natural regeneration, partial protection of the forest from forest fires could promote this phenomenon.

The ripe fruits are collected from the ground or picked from the tree. Fresh seed can be sown in flat seedling trays filled with a mixture of river sand and compost (5:1). Germination is usually good, between 80-100%; pretreatment of seed, such as scarification or soaking in cold water for 12 hours, enhances germination. The seedlings should be transplanted into black nursery bags filled with a well-drained mixture of river sand, loam and compost (2:2:1). Potted stock must be raised in the nursery and planted in the field, from where the vegetation must be partially cleared as the species is a light demander.
  Humans find the sweet, datelike taste of the fruit quite pleasant. The sugar content of the pulp is as high as 30%, and seeds taste like walnuts. The vitamin C content of the fruit is 65 mg/100 g. The fruit may be eaten boiled with sorghum. A beverage similar to tea is made from the leaves. Large quantities of the fruit are collected, dried and stored and later used by people in the low veld areas of South Africa.
The fruit and leaves can be used as fodder.
Apiculture:  Bees are attracted to the small yellow-green flowers found in loose clusters on the tree. 
Timber:  An important timber species of southern Africa. The sapwood is pale brown; heartwood hard, heavy (air-dry 992 kg/m³) and fine grained, yellow-brown with a reddish tinge. The wood is excellent for making furniture such as tables, chairs and benches and is also used in making poles, pestles and hair combs.
Shade or shelter:  The spreading branches and heavy, rounded crown make B. discolor an effective shade tree; it can also act as a windbreak.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Black dye, popular with basket makers, is produced from powdered heartwood and roots. 
Medicine:  The roots have various medicinal uses.
Gum or resin:  The heartwood produces a resin.
Ornamental: B. discolor is planted as an ornamental. The tree presents a challenge to anyone trying to make a bonsai from it, but if the effort is successful, it is one of the best indigenous trees for this form of art.
Alcohol:  A strong alcoholic drink is distilled from the fruit."
Bertholletia excelsa,"Local names:
 Chinese (pahsi li), English (Brazil nut,para nut,cream nut,butter nut), French (chatáigne du brésil,noix du pará,noix du brésil), German (paranuss,Paranußaum,Brasilnußbaum), Italian (noce del brasilie), Japanese (burajiru nattsu), Portuguese (castahna-do
Bertholletia excelsa is a large tree, 40-60 m tall; trunk very straight for 20 m or more; diameter ranges from 2 to 4 m; bark grey-brown, 1.5 cm thick, resinous, with deep, narrow, longitudinal fissures that are reddish internally; crown 10-20 m in diameter and round or umbrella shaped; seedlings and adult trees develop strong taproots that may penetrate up to 3 m or more in heavy clays.

Leaves simple, alternate, lack stipules and have petioles 2-6 cm long; blade oblong to elliptic, 17-45 cm long, 6.5-15.5 cm wide; apex rounded and acuminate; base rounded; leathery, coppery to bright green; margins wavy; veins prominent, especially on the leaf underside.

Inflorescence terminal or in axillary panicles, 10-20 cm in length, with 10-40 subsessile, bisexual, globose flowers, 2-3 cm in diameter; calyx 15 mm long with subcircular concave lobes, enveloping the flower except for a narrow slit at the apex; 6 oblong, yellow-cream petals curve over a thick receptacle; stamens short and numerous; inferior ovary that contains 4 or more locular ovules with short styles.

Fruit a large, indehiscent, globose, woody capsule (pixidium), 8-15 cm in diameter, weighing 500-1500 g; pericarp 1 cm thick and barklike. Seeds 15-25, 3-4 cm long, angular, with hard, woody coat and thin, adhering testa; tightly packed within the fruit; they have a white kernel and a nutty texture.

The generic name commemorates Claude-Louis Berthollet (1748-1822), a French chemist. The specific epithet alludes to its lofty height.
Ecology

B. excelsa is found in the warm, wet lowland rainforest but is also common in the drier regions of transitional forests. Trees normally occupy well-drained sites, but some populations occur on seasonally flooded alluvial soils along the Amazon near Alenquer, Pará, in Brazil.
Native range
Brazil
Tree management

Grafted trees are planted in clay soils at a spacing of 10 x 15 m or 20 x 20 m. Small fires may be set at the base of trees during the dry season to clear away debris so that capsules can be easily collected later; heat or smoke from the fire also stimulates flowering and increases yield. Trees 16 years old produce 30-50 fruits, mature trees usually 200-400, and a yield of 1000 fruits has been reported. Fruits are collected beneath the trees within a few weeks of falling. If nuts are stored and transported under precarious conditions for many weeks before they are dried, they may become infected with aflatoxins.
Storage behaviour is intermediate: 3% germination after 18 months in open storage at room temperature. Viability is maintained better in storage with intact seeds than those with no pericarp and is reduced from 60 to 2% on desiccation from 14.2 to 4.2% mc. The lowest safe moisture content is 12%. There are about 65 seeds/kg.
B. excelsa is found in the warm, wet lowland rainforest but is also common in the drier regions of transitional forests. Trees normally occupy well-drained sites, but some populations occur on seasonally flooded alluvial soils along the Amazon near Alenquer, Pará, in Brazil.
Propagation is mainly by seed, which may take 0.5-3 years to germinate; natural regeneration is poor. Seed shells can be scarified or removed to reduce germination time to as little as 20 days, and light is probably important for further growth. If the conditions are right, some of the seeds buried by rodents may germinate. Trees appear to depend on natural or artificial disturbance to reproduce. For example, they will be found in clearings in the forest created by humans, forest gaps created by tree fall, or sproutings from damaged mother roots. Trees take about 10 years to start reproducing; grafted material may begin to bear nuts within 4 years. Other than using a single clone, several selections are cloned and grafted onto stock to encourage cross-fertilization, which increases yield.
There are some attempts to use the species in poor pasture, initially as a shade tree and eventually as a revegetation material.
  Dry nuts contain 63-69% oil, 14-17% protein and 4% fibre, so they are a good source of calories and protein. Kernels are eaten raw, toasted or used in confectionery, often as a substitute for other nuts or grated coconut.
The oil in the nut is expressed and used as livestock feed.
Dried fruit capsules are useful as fuel; the nut, which has an elevated oil content of 63-69%, burns with a candlelike flame when lit.
Fibre:  The bark has been used in remote regions for fibre production.
Timber: B. excelsa is a source of fine timber, and the durable wood is sought by boat builders. Fruit pericarps are sometimes used to make carvings.
Medicine:  Folk medicine for liver problems is obtained from the bark of the tree.
Soil improver:  A mixture of B. exelsa shells and manure is used in Brazil to fertilize Brachiaria humidicola pasture.
Intercropping:  B. excelsa is an excellent candidate for an overstorey species in mixed cropping systems, and Brazilian farmers are interplanting it with cacao in the vicinity of Tomé Açu, Pará, in eastern Amazonia."

The generic name commemorates Prof. G.W. Bischoff of Heidelberg, Germany, 1797-1854.
Ecology

The tree prefers areas with a distinct dry season. It is common but usually found scattered in primary and old secondary dry and deciduous forest or monsoon forest but also in evergreen forest, swamp and teak forest, sometimes in more open places like savanna tracts. It is more frequent on riverbanks, shady ravines and prefers deep loose soils such as sandy, rocky or loamy soils with sufficient water content. In monsoon forest of Timor, it is found in association with Alstonia scholaris, Cordia subpubescens, Exocarpos latifolia, Ficus saxophila, Tetrameles nudiflora and Toona sureni.
Native range
Australia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Thailand, Tonga
Tree management

The tree is well suited for large-scale plantations. In Java, it has been planted in pure stands at 2 m x 3 m, and in mixed plantations in alternating rows with Calophyllum inophyllum and Bombax ceiba at 1 m x 3 m, and with Acacia mearnsii at 2.5 m x 5 m. Self-pruning of thick branches is good once the canopy closes after about 5 years at a spacing of 2 m x 3 m. Closer planting reduces this period. Pruning wounds heal well and the tree survives girdling. In Java, an 8-year-old pure plantation with a spacing of 2 m x 3 m yielded 12 m³/ha of clear-bole wood.
There are 61 500-90 000 seeds/kg. Seed storage behaviour is uncertain, viability maintained for 3 months in open storage at room temperature, after which it is reduced. Seed may be collected in large quantities and can be stored for up to 6 months. Seed may be sown under shade or full sunlight, provided water is adequate. Germination starts 1-3 weeks after sowing and after 5-6 weeks about 70 % of the seed have germinated.

The tree can be propagated by seed, wildings and stem cuttings. Young plants need plenty of water, therefore direct sowing in the field is not appropriate. Stumps should be robust, at least 2.5 cm in diameter and shoot and root length 20 cm and 30 cm respectively.
B. javanica is used for afforestation.
  The young soft leaves are cooked and eaten as a vegetable.
Although the wood is not suitable as a fuelwood, it is used for charcoal production.
Fibre:  The tree is a potential source of long fibres for pulp and paper production.
Timber:  Bishop wood is medium-weight and moderately hard. The heartwood is purplish-brown to reddish-brown and is sharply differentiated from the narrow, pale brown to pale reddish-brown sapwood. The density is 520-1 010 kg/m³ at 15 % moisture content, grain is generally interlocked, texture moderately fine to rather coarse and even, wood surface dull to slightly glossy. Fresh wood smells of vinegar. It is used for general construction (beams, posts), bridges, decking, sleepers, mining props, flooring, interior finish, veneer, plywood, implements, carving etc.
Shade or shelter:  In India, the tree is considered to be an excellent shade tree in coffee and cardamom plantations.
Tannin or dyestuff:  A red dye obtained from the bark is used to stain rattan baskets. The bark also contains about 16 % tannin that is employed in the toughening of nets and ropes.
Medicine:  B. javanica has been shown to have antiulcer, anthelmintic and antidysenteric activities.
Ornamental:  The tree has been introduced as a fast-growing ornamental in Africa and the USA.
Intercropping: B. javanica is often intercropped in traditional agriculture."
Bixa orellana,"Local names:
 Arabic (galuga), Bengali (latkan), Creole (chiót,woukou), English (lipstick tree,arnato tree,annatto tree), Filipino (sotis,echuete), French (chiote,annatto,roucou,rocouyer,annato), Hindi (latkan), Indonesian (kunyit jawa,kesumba,jarak belanda), Javanese
Bixa orellana is an evergreen shrub or small tree, 2-8 m high; trunk up to 10 cm in diameter; bark light to dark brown, tough, smooth, sometimes fissured, lenticellate; inner bark pinkish towards the outside with orange sap, slightly bitter; twigs green with minute, rusty, reddish-brown scales, becoming dark brown.

Flowers in terminal branched panicles, 8-50 flowered, fragrant, 4-6 cm across; pedicel scaly, thickened at the apex, bearing 5-6 large glands; sepals 4-5, free, obovate, 1-1.2 cm long, caducous, covered with reddish-brown scales; petals 4-7, obovate, 2-3 x 1-2 cm, pinkish, whitish or purplish tinged; stalks scaly; stamens numerous, 1.6 cm long; anthers violet; pistil 1.6 cm long, composed of bristly 1-celled, superior ovary; style thickened upwards, 12-15 mm long; a short, 2-lobed stigma.

Fruit a spherical or broadly elongated ovoid capsule, 2-4 x 2-3.5 cm, flattened, 2 valved, more or less densely cloaked with long bristles, green, greenish-brown or red when mature; seeds numerous, obovoid and angular, 4.5 mm long, with bright orange-red fleshy coats.

‘Bixa’ is derived from a local South American name.
Ecology

B. orellana requires a frost-free, warm, humid climate and a sunny location. It can grow in tropical to subtropical climates where rainfall is distributed throughout the year.
Native range
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Surinam, Uruguay, Venezuela
Tree management

Seeds are sown at a spacing of 25 x 10 cm and at a minimum depth of 2.5 cm because of their long taproots. Seedlings are planted out from the nursery after about 4 months, when they are about 15-25 cm in height. When planting them out, precautions should be taken to minimize sun scorch and damage to the roots. Weeding must be done as often as possible to keep the young trees free of weeds, but care must be taken not to disturb the roots. Mulching is necessary if there is not enough rainfall to keep the soil moist. Pruning is practiced to produce a canopy that is easy to harvest, although this may impede a 2nd harvest from the same branch within the same year. The mature fruit bunch is cut with sharp clippers just above the node below the branch; this way a 2nd crop may be collected in a 12-month period.
Reported yields are 4.5-5 kg of dried seed/tree per year. Storage behaviour is intermediate; seeds tolerate desiccation to 10% mc, but further desiccation to 4.2% mc reduces viability. Longevity is reduced for seeds stored at -20 deg. C. Sun-dried seeds retain viability for over 1 year, but germination reduces to 12% when stored for 3 years. Seeds stored for 12 months at 23 deg. C and 45% r.h. or 9.8% mc experience no loss in viability; little loss is experienced with seeds at 9.8% mc and 5 deg. C, while storage temperatures of 5 deg. C and -20 deg. C damage the viability of seeds at 4.2% mc.
B. orellana requires a frost-free, warm, humid climate and a sunny location. It can grow in tropical to subtropical climates where rainfall is distributed throughout the year.
B. orellana is usually grown from seed taken from freshly gathered ripe pods, which germinate better than dry ones. Germination is epigeal. Vegetative propagation is possible by means of budding, air-layering or cuttings. Propagating by cuttings allows selection of high-yielding, rapidly growing cultivars that flower early and profusely and bear fruit within 2 years.
Poison:  A waxy substance that has paralytic action on mammalian intestinal parasites is present in the seed coat. Bixin extracted from the seed coat is used in India as an insect repellent.
  In Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, the thin pigmented pulp covering the seeds is used as a condiment.
Bixa meal, which remains after extraction of the pigment from the seed, is a useful additive to poultry feed and can replace 30% of the maize in the food. However, the seed embryo contains a poisonous alkaloid, so it is not wise to use the residues from the extraction process directly.
Apiculture:  The flowers are a source of nectar for honey.
It is said that fire can be started by the friction of 2 pieces of the soft wood.
Fibre:  Fibre for cordage has been obtained from the bark of B. orellana.
Timber:  The sapwood is whitish and the heartwood light brown or yellowish. The wood is soft, light weight (specific gravity 0.4), porous, weak and not durable.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The extract from the pigment coating the seeds yields a harmless, non-carcinogenic dye, used as colouring for food, especially dairy products. This dye was also used by Amerindians as war paint and was used in dying wool, cotton and silk, but the colour rapidly fades when exposed to light and air. The dye obtained from the seed is used in manufacturing cosmetics.
Medicine:  Leaves are applied to the head and to sprains to relieve aches; a decoction is gargled as a cure for mouth and throat infections. Leaves may also be used in baths to relieve colic or to get rid of worms in children. A root decoction is taken orally to control asthma. A macerated seed decoction is taken orally for relief of fever, and the pulp surrounding the seed is made into an astringent drink used to treat dysentery and kidney infection. Oliguria and jaundice are treated using root teas; infusions of root in water and rum are used to treat venereal diseases. The dye is used as an antidote for prussic acid poisoning caused by poorly treated Manihot esculenta. Seeds are used as expectorant.
Gum or resin:  Bark from the branches of the trees yields a water-soluble gum that is similar to gum arabic.
Intercropping:  B. orellana has been successfully cultivated with young citrus groves.
Essential oil:  Seeds contain a characteristic pleasant-smelling oil."
Blighia sapida,"Local names:
 Creole (arbe fricasse), English (breadfruit,akee apple,akee,ackee), French (fisanier,aki,Abre-à-fricasser), Spanish (seso vegetal)
Blighia sapida may reach 13 m high, has a spreading crown and ribbed branchlets. 

Leaflets 2-5 pairs, the upper ones largest, obovate. Leaves oblong or sub-elliptic, acute to rounded base, 3-18 cm long, 2-8.5 cm broad, pubescent on the nerves beneath.

Flowers bisexual, aromatic and greenish white in colour, borne on densely pubescent axillary racemes, 5-20 cm long.

Fruit capsule shaped, leather like pods contain a seed in each of 3 chambers or sections. A thick fleshy stalk, rich in oil, holds the seeds. When ripe, the fruit sections split and the seed becomes visible. The fruit turns red on reaching maturity and splits open with continued exposure to the sun. 

Seeds shiny black with a large yellow or whitish aril.

The generic name Blighia honours Captain William Bligh who introduced the plant to the English scientific community at Kew in 1793. The specific epithet is in reference to the presence of substances in its seeds which turn water soapy or frothy.
Ecology

Found in areas outlying forests in the savanna regions and in drier parts of the eastern half of the West African region, B. sapida is a climax forest species commonly associated with Strombosia pustulata.
Native range
Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo
Tree management

Traditionally between January-March and June-August the fruits are harvested and the arils removed and cleaned in preparation for cooking.
Found in areas outlying forests in the savanna regions and in drier parts of the eastern half of the West African region, B. sapida is a climax forest species commonly associated with Strombosia pustulata.
Poison:  While its popularity has never faltered, the fruit killed around five thousand Jamaicans between 1886 and 1950. Consumers of the unripe fruit sometimes suffer from 'Jamaican vomiting sickness syndrome' (JVS) allegedly caused by the unusual amino acid components, hypoglycin A and B. Levels of hypoglycin A in the arilli peak at maturity but rapidly diminish to non-detectable levels in the opened fruit making it safe for consumption. Although JVS has resulted in some fatalities in the past with symptoms including vomiting and severe hypoglycaemia, nowadays such incidences are rare with the increased awareness of the necessity for consuming only ripe, opened fruits. The rind contains saporin and may be used to poison fish so that they will be rendered easier to catch. The seeds, aril, and oily stalk are highly poisonous. If seeds are swallowed, sudden and violent vomiting occurs, followed by convulsions, coma and death. Because of its potential danger, the Jamaican government has banned the fruit canning for export.
Erosion control:  B. sapida roots protect soil from water erosion.
 This delicacy is enjoyed by many at breakfast or as an entree. Parboiled and then fried, it  has a nutty flavour, excellent with fish or bacon. Cooked, it resembles a ""vegetable brain."" The canned product is exported to ethnic markets worldwide and continues to be enjoyed by both visitors to the island and Jamaicans residing overseas.
Apiculture: The flowers are visited by bees for pollen and nectar.
Good quality charcoal is produced from B. sapida wood.
Timber:  Timber from B. sapida is used in making furniture.
Shade or shelter:  It is a useful shade tree in homes, parks and gardens.
Lipids:  The purified oil from the fruit has high nutritive value and makes an important contribution to the fatty acid intake of many Jamaicans and West Africans. Linoleic, palmitic and stearic acids are the major fatty acids observed in the arillus with linoleic accounting for over 55% of the total fatty acids.
Medicine:  In Ghana several uses are recorded for B. sapida; the bark is one of the ingredients in a concoction administered for epilepsy. Leaf juice is used for washing or as drops for sore eyes, conjuntivitis and trachoma. The pulp of twiggy leaves is applied on the forehead to treat migraine/ headache.
Ornamental:  Commonly planted along avenues, it enhances aesthetic value of urban landscapes.
Soil improver:  Soils under the B. sapida canopy have more organic matter and greater potassium contents (Muoghalu & Awokunle 1994)."
Bombacopsis quinata,"Local names:
 English (red ceiba), French (mahot coton), Spanish (tolu,saqui-saqui,pochote,ceiba tolú,ceiba roja,ceiba colorado,cedro espino), Trade name (red ceiba,cedro espino)
Bombacopsis quinata reaches a height of 40 m and a trunk diameter of more than 1 m in natural stands. Its most distinguishing features are its spiny main stem, fluted base, a rather wide spreading crown of heavy branches and a somewhat irregular bole inclined to be buttressed and completely clothed with heavy prickles towards the base; bark pale greyish-brown, trunk and branches generally covered by hard, stout spines up to 2 cm long; degree of spininess is extremely variable, as some trees are completely spineless.

Leaves alternate, palmate and composite, with 3-5 oblong or obovate glabrous leaflets.

Fruit a woody 5-valved capsule that upon bursting frees soft brown vegetable wool enclosing 30-120 small, brown seeds.
Ecology

B. quinata is found in dry to very dry, or wet tropical forests, associated with Acacia costaricensis, Acacia farnesiana, Albizia caribaea, Albizia saman, Anacardium excelsum, Astronium graveolens, Cedrela odorata, Cordia alliodora and Swietenia macrophylla.
Native range
Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela
Tree management

Adequate weed control is essential to achieve acceptable survival and growth. Fertilization is not generally required at plantation establishment, in young plantations or on sites with good native soil fertility. Pruning and thinning are performed in plantations managed for veneer production. Pruning to leave a single stem is required within 1 year after planting to eliminate multiple stems that develop from sprouting of stump plants. This formation pruning occurs during the 1st dry season following planting, but on best sites where rapid tree growth occurs, it must be done 3-4 months after planting. Branch pruning is done to produce clear wood and begins when the trees are approximately 6 m tall, with the removal of lower branches up to 3 m stem height. Tentative thinning regime calls for the reduction of stems from a planting density of 1000 to 550 trees/ha at 5-7 years, with subsequent thinning to 300 trees/ha in 11-13 year-old plantations. At final harvest (age 16-18 years), trees are expected to have an average mean diameter at breast height of 40-45 cm.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seeds tolerate desiccation to 7.2% mc with 90% germination; 77% germination is achieved after 1 year subsequent storage at 5 deg. C. Seeds lose viability rapidly if the capsules are collected too early, but seed collected from capsules harvested at full maturity keep well for at least 2-3 years. There are 32 000 seeds/kg.
B. quinata is found in dry to very dry, or wet tropical forests, associated with Acacia costaricensis, Acacia farnesiana, Albizia caribaea, Albizia saman, Anacardium excelsum, Astronium graveolens, Cedrela odorata, Cordia alliodora and Swietenia macrophylla.
B. quinata is relatively easy to propagate vegetatively. Large diameter cuttings from semi-mature trees root well. They have been used successfully to establish clonal seed orchards in Colombia, Costa Rica and Venezuela. Best rooting is obtained from cuttings from shoots, which develop following felling of young trees, or from cuttings from stem material of young nursery stock. Sprouting is enhanced when trees are felled at the end of the dry season before leaf flush. Seeds do not require pregermination treatment and initiate root radicles within 8 days of sowing.
Timber:  The heartwood of B. quinata is reddish in colour and the sapwood cream or white. The wood is known for its durability and workability; it is used for furniture, doors, window and ceiling frames, roof construction, interior panelling, particleboard, plywood and veneer.
Shade or shelter: In other occasions, the trees have been left standing to give shade in coffee plantations (Nicaragua) or, most frequently, as remnant trees in cattle pasture. 
In Costa Rica and Nicaragua the establishment of living fencerows from vegetative propagated stakes is common practice, with spacings ranging from 2-5 m.
Intercropping: There are examples of intercropping with maize, although only for the first two years of the plantation, due to a quick canopy closure."
Bombax costatum,"Local names:
 English (red-flowered silk cotton tree), French (kapokier rouge ou faux kapokier,kapokier), Mandinka (bunkungo,bungkungo), Wolof (kattupa,garablaobe)
Bombax costatum is a deciduous tree up to 25 m high, in the Sahel hardly over 6 m. Crown structure of young trees storeyed, becoming irregular and sturdy in older trees. Bark thick, grey brown and corky, with typical conical, stout, sharp-pointed spines on the stem and branches. Slash light red-brown.

Leaves digitately compound, with 5-7 leaflets, 8-15 cm long, on long petioles. Leaflets partly ovate, partly acuminate at both ends, with 8-10 pairs of lateral nerves. 

Flowers (5-6 cm) long and solitary, deep red, orange or yellow, tulip-shaped, on long, glabrous peduncles. Calyx cup-shaped.

Fruit a dark brown, ellipsoidal capsule, composed of 5 valves, dehiscent, 8-16 cm long and 3-6 cm wide, of variable shape. The valves are furrowed for about one third the distance from the top to the middle.

Fruit contains white floss, called kapok and several small seeds.

The genus name 'Bombax' is derived from the Greek 'bombux', meaning silk, alluding to the dense wool-like floss covering the inner walls of the fruits and the seeds.
Ecology

B. costatum is a fire resisting tree of the savannas and dry woodlands from Senegal to central Africa, from Guinea across Ghana and Nigeria to southern Chad. Its tuberous roots act as water and/or sugar storage facilities during long drought periods. Usually associated with Pterocarpus erinaceus, Daniellia oliveri, Cordyla pinnata, Parkia biglobosa, Terminalia macroptera and Prosopis africana.
Native range
Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal
Tree management

Planting of isolated trees recommended. A tree bears up to 1 500 fruits each with 5-8 kg of kapok. Under favourable conditions, 3-5 kg kapok per tree can be obtained from the 10th year onwards. Kapok is very resistant to fire.
There are 17 000-27 000 seeds /kg.

Usually associated with Pterocarpus erinaceus, Daniellia oliveri, Cordyla pinnata, Parkia biglobosa, Terminalia macroptera and Prosopis africana.
Direct seeding is a preferred propagation mode, however wildlings may also be used. The seedlings are difficult to plant inspite of their vigorous rooting ability. Natural regeneration easy and abundant when sufficiently protected against fire and livestock.
Poison: B. costatum extracts exhibit molluscicidal activity.
Erosion control:  Supports dry lateritic soils.
 The calyx of the flowers is used in ‘futo’ or sauces and the young fruit is cut around August and September, dried, and used for the preparation of meals. The unripe fruit is cut in pieces and used in the production of a beverage. The high protein content, low content of toxic substances and amount of polyunsaturated fats in seed oil suggest that B. costatum is potentially suitable for human and animal consumption.
Fodder: Leaves are highly digestible and are eaten by livestock. B. costatum regenerates strongly after grazing.
Apiculture:  An important bee forage species.
Fibre:  Kapok fibre is obtained from the fruit. Fibres are mainly used as filling, especially for pillows.
Timber:  The wood is pale yellow to whitish with an orange lustre when newly felled, it soon turns grey when exposed to sunlight. There are no visible differences between the heartwood and the sapwood. The wood is very soft and weighs 350-450 kg/m³ when air-dried. It is moderately solid, easy to season and not liable to major warping or shrinkage. Untreated, the wood is soon attacked and destroyed by fungi and insects. Wood is workable, timber used in constructing dug-out canoes and match-stick manufacture.
Shade or shelter:  Provides ample shade to livestock.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark has tannins and yields a brown dye.
Lipids: Seeds of B. costatum have a high oil content (19.8%) and can be a possible oil source.
Medicine:  The bark is used for the treatment of skin diseases, yellow fever and headache, leaves and immature fruit as an emmolient. Various parts are used for fever or to promote lactation and as tonic for fatigue.
Being a fire resistant species the tree can serve well as a boundary mark.
Soil improver:  The leaf litter enhances soil fertility.
Intercropping: B. costatum trees are associated with the agricultural environment, this attests their agroforestry significance"
Borassus aethiopum,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (borasusspalm), Amharic (zembaba), Arabic (deleib,delieb), Bemba (kambili,kakoma,chibangalala), English (fan palm,deleb palm,African fan palm,palmyra palm,borassus palm,ron palm), French (palmier ronier,rônier), Fula (dubbe,dubbi), German (palm
Borassus aethiopum is an unbranched palm growing up to 20 m tall, characterized by a crown up to 8 m wide; young palms are covered with dry leaf stalks, showing gradually fading leaf scars; trees over 25 years old have a swelling of the trunk at 12-15 m above the ground (at 2/3 of the height); bark is pale grey in older palms and is more or less smooth.

Leaves very large, fan shaped, bluish-green, 15-30, up to 3.5 m long, including petiole which is marked with sharp, black thorns; leaflets symmetric at the base.

Flowers dioecious, yellowish; male flowers clustered in a branched spadix, 0.8-1.8 m long. Female flowers with unbranched and shorter spadix, 1.3-2.6 m long.

The fruit a large drupe, diameter about 15 cm, ovoid, orange to brown when ripe; fibrous pulp contains 3 woody kernels with an albumen that becomes hard when ripe.

This genus is probably the only tropical species that bears a generic name so old that its meaning has been lost in time. The name ‘flabellifer’ means ‘fan shaped’ and refers to the shape of the leaves.
Ecology

Distributed in the Guineo-Congolian and Sudanian savannahs, B. aethiopum is abundant and characteristic in all types of savannah of the region, occurring at low altitudes along rivers and in coastal woodlands. It can tolerate high temperatures and will grow in areas with rainfall less than 500 mm/yr if the groundwater table is high. It is often in dense stands. The palm can serve as an excellent firebreak, especially in the arid regions of West Africa, which are prone to wildfires.
Native range
Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Growth of the palms depends very much on site conditions. Three phases of growth are recognized. The 1st phase takes 6-8 years and involves leaf development, in which about 20 leaves grow in a wide crown (about 3 x 3 m). There is very little upward growth then. The 2nd phase involves rapid growth of the trunk above the ground and takes place from the 8th to about the 20th year. The bark of the tree will still be rough and have many leafstalks. The 3rd phase involves flowering and shedding of leafstalks. The trunk becomes smooth and swellings appear on it.

Little care is required if palms are established on a good site. However, young leaves should be harvested only under very controlled conditions if the palm is to grow properly. Rotation periods depend on the site but can be 60-140 years.

For palm wine tapping, the terminal bud of the tree is cut and the dripping sap of the phloem is collected in a receptacle. The cut is renewed twice every day for 3-4 weeks until the tree is exhausted and dies. During this period B. aethiopum can yield about 200-500 litres of sap. Overtapping of the tree for its sap has made the tree rare.
Seeds have a very short period of viability and should be sown directly after they are removed from the pulp. It has been suggested that this species may not show recalcitrant seed storage behaviour. There are 2-3 seeds/kg.
Distributed in the Guineo-Congolian and Sudanian savannahs, B. aethiopum is abundant and characteristic in all types of savannah of the region, occurring at low altitudes along rivers and in coastal woodlands. It can tolerate high temperatures and will grow in areas with rainfall less than 500 mm/yr if the groundwater table is high. It is often in dense stands. The palm can serve as an excellent firebreak, especially in the arid regions of West Africa, which are prone to wildfires.
The seed can be sown without removing the surrounding pulp. Germination takes 1 month. Pretreatment is not necessary. However, removal of the seed coat by excision breaks the long and unpredictable dormancy and results in a higher germination percentage. The poor germination is a severe handicap in agricultural practice. Another agronomic drawback is that once it sprouts, the seedling cannot be transplanted or planted out.
  The fruits have a large, fibrous pulp (around 500 g each) that smells strongly of therbenthine. They are consumed raw or cooked, preferably with rice. The kernels contain an albumen, which before ripening is sweet and refreshing. The immature seeds can be eaten and contain a sweet jelly that has a refreshing taste. The mature seeds can be buried in pits and allowed to germinate, and the shoots are said to be a delicacy. Fresh sap is used as a yeast or made into vinegar.
Fruits and young leaves are sometimes browsed for fodder.
Apiculture:  In Uganda, B. aethiopum trees are cut and hollowed out to make beehives.
Firewood and charcoal can be obtained from B. aethiopum.
Fibre:  The fibre extracted from the base of the leaf stalk has valuable qualities of resistance to chemicals, termites and water. Young leaves, before unfolding, can be split into strips and woven into thin mats, baskets and other household objects. The leaf midribs are used to make brooms, fish traps and nets. The leafstalk endings can be soaked in water to provide fibres that are used as sponges or filters.
Timber:  The wood is hard, moderately heavy and brown with black fibres. The strong trunks are very resistant to decay and to insects, especially termites. They are frequently used as posts and for construction of bridges. The boards cut from the trunks are used for the construction of shower cabins. The trunk and leaf stalks are used to make stakes. In Mozambique, people use the trees to make dugout canoes. Other products include door frames, roof materials, tool handles and drums.
Shade or shelter:  Mature leaves are used for roofing.
Lipids:  Oil can be extracted from the fruit and pulp.
Medicine:  In traditional medicine, palm wine is a component of several aphrodisiac preparations. The flowers help against aphonia, and young leaves are used to stop haemorrhage.
Ornamental:  B. aethiopum is an attractive palm and has been planted for amenity purposes.
Alcohol:  B. aethiopum is particularly appreciated because of its sap, tapped from flower spikes, which ferments to palm wine, ‘kue za’, the traditional beverage of the Baoulé of Cote d’Ivoire. Palm wine can be distilled to form ‘koutoukou’, but this spir"
Boscia angustifolia,"Local names:

B. angustifolia is difficult to raise but direct seeding is recommended for its propagation.
The shrub readily establishes itself in adverse conditions and has potential for reclaiming degraded sites.
  Fruit and seeds are edible after cooking. Stripped bark is eaten mixed with millet or as soup in West Africa. Pieces of boiled wood are used to sweeten milk.
The foliage is consumed by camels and small livestock, especially at the time of flowering and towards the end of the dry season.
Apiculture: In Zambia it is a good source of bee forage.
The tree was formerly converted into charcoal for gunpowder.
Timber:  Wood hard, used in carpentry and water storage vessels.
Shade or shelter:  The tree provides shade for livestock.
Medicine: Bark is applied on swollen feet, for kidney pains and stiff neck, roots for chest pains, fruit as a laxative. Pounded leaves are used as tonic for horses and camels."
Boscia senegalensis,"Local names:
 Arabic (shagara al muknet,moheb,makhei,kursan,hemmet,bokkhelli), Bambara (bere), Bislama (hamta), Hausa (hansa,dilo,anza), Wolof (diendoum)
Boscia senegalensis is an evergreen undershrub or more rarely a shrub, usually 1-2 m tall, but sometimes up to 4 m, particularly in good conditions;stem darkish.

Leaves of a greenish mat hue, coriaceus, spread or erect, elliptic, or ovate-elliptic, obtuse or mucronate, reaching 12 cm x 4 cm, with 5-6 lateral veins arranged in arcs ending at the tip of the following vein and linked together by a network of smaller veins producing a polygonal pattern on the lower side of the leaf. Veins protruding on the lower face; white veins very conspicuous on the upper side, contrasting with the green of the leaf blade.

Flowers have a tiny pedicel, they are hairy, greenish-white with four valvular, hairy sepals, no petals, 6-20 free stamens inserted at the base of a short gynophorum inside a thick disc sometimes somewhat fringed. Ovary ovoid with very short style and only one loculum with many ovules.

Fruit a spherical berry, 1.5 (1.2) cm in diameter, yellow when mature, shortly subsessile, clustered in small bunches (with usually 2-3 fruits only). Slightly but not always hairy. The epicarp is crustaceus; the pulp is translucent, of jelly-like texture, slightly sweet but otherwise tasteless. It contains 1-2 (1-4) ventrally flattened seeds, greenish when mature.
Ecology

B. senegalensis is often a common tree in open scrub or savanna woodland, but can also form a thick understorey in woodland and dry forest. It occurs in Pteleopsis, Acacia-Ziziphus, Anogeissus and Acacia-commiphora woodlands. This is a sahelo-saharan species which, in Mauritania and the Sudan, occurs below the 20th parallel, while its southern limit runs from Dakar to northern Burkina Faso, the Niger-Nigerian border, the southern bank of lake Chad and southern Kordofan. It may also exist in south-east Egypt. It is mainly found under rainfalls of 100-300 mm. The type B. octandra is reckoned to be more xerophytic and therefore better adapted to very arid sites.
Native range
Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Togo
There are 2 500-3 500 seeds/kg.

It may also exist in south-east Egypt. It is mainly found under rainfalls of 100-300 mm. The type B. octandra is reckoned to be more xerophytic and therefore better adapted to very arid sites.
As there have not been any agricultural trials for this species, it is not possible to assess production potential, but there should be much potential for yield if domesticated. Some work on its yield shows that B. senegalensis may yield up to 3.9 kg /ha of fruit in drought years and even in extreme drought conditions can yield 0.22 kg/ha.
Poison: The leaves are used to protect stored food against parasites in granary. Leafless twigs contain glucosinalates, which can hydrolyze to mustard oils, which are highly toxic and irritant to mucous membranes.
 The fruit is often gathered for human consumption; usually very acid, it becomes edible after soaking in water for about a week. In the eastern Sudan for instance, men and women may spend up to 8 hours a day searching for B. senegalensis. The fruits are frequently sold in the markets for food. It is a regular item of diet in saharo-sahelian zone and sahel, further south, they are mainly supplementary, but their main value is as an emergency food. Seeds are a staple food of the Peuhls of Senegal, but also an important famine food.
Fodder: It is generally not valued for forage; but has potential if leaves could be debittered and prepared as a powder or granules and made appetizing to livestock. The leaves are little sought after by camels, at least in Niger and in the Sudan. Small livestock occasionally consume them during the bridging period. 
As firewood, it burns making much smoke.
Timber:  Wood is soft and workable when boiled and in Mauritania, when large enough, is used in house construction.
Medicine:  In Niger, an infusion of leaves is used to remove intestinal parasites from camels. Leaves contain the alkaloids L-stachydrine and hydroxy-3 stachydrine. Stachydrine affects aggregation of thrombocytes and shortens the bleeding time. Roots are vermifuge and leaves mixed with millet flour taken each morning on an empty stomach is anthelminthic; draught from leaves or dried bark taken for schistosomiasis. Infusion of the leaves used as an eyewash in Sudan and for pruritus of the eye due to syphilis in Senegal. 
In some areas of the Sudan, the tree is being cut increasingly for dead hedging. It is however unsuitable for this purpose and live hedging using other species should be encouraged.
Alcohol: The fruit is fermented into a beer in the Sudan."
Boswellia serrata,"Local names:
 Arabic (kuurdur), Bemba (kundur), Bengali (luban,salai), English (Indian frankincense tree,Indian olibanum tree), Gujarati (gugal,saleda,dhup), Hindi (madi,salai,saler,salga,salhe,sali), Sanskrit (sallaki,kunduru), Tamil (parangisambrani,kungli,kundrikam
Boswellia serrata is a moderate-sized to large, deciduous tree with a light, spreading crown and somewhat drooping branches. It usually has a short bole, 3-5 m in length, sometimes longer if grown in a fully stocked forest. Ordinarily, it attains a girth of 1.2-1.8 m and a height of 9-15 m. Bark is very thin, greyish-green, ashy or reddish with a chlorophyll layer beneath the thin outer layer, which peels off in thin, papery flakes.

Leaves alternate, exstipulate, imparipinnate, 20-45 cm in length, crowded towards the ends of the branches; leaflets 17-31 cm, opposite, 2.5-8 cm x 0.8-1.5 cm, basal pairs often smallest, sessile, lanceolate, ovate-lanceolate, crenate, very variable in size.

Flowers white, in stout racemes, 10-20 cm long, shorter than the leaves, crowded towards the ends of branches, but not terminal. Calyx persistent, pubescent outside, 5 to 7-toothed; teeth small, deltoid. Petals 5-7 erect, free, 0.5 cm long.

Fruits 1.3 cm long, trigonous, with three valves and three heart-shaped, 1-seeded pyrenes, winged, along with the margins.

The specific name, serrata, comes from serra (a saw) referring to the toothed leaf-margins.
Ecology

B. serrata is a species characteristic of the tropical dry deciduous forests and occurs in very dry teak forests or in dry mixed deciduous forests in association with species such as Terminalia spp., Anogeissus latifolia and Acacia leucophloea. It is characteristically found on the slopes and ridges of hills, as well as on flat terrain, attaining a larger size on fertile soils. It is resistant to drought and resists fire better than other species in its zone of occurrence. The tree is also frost hardy and serves as a nurse tree for other species.
Native range
India, Pakistan
Tree management

The mixed forests in which B. serrata occurs are worked under selection-cum-improvement or under one of the coppice systems such as the coppice with standards, with a rotation of 40 years, or the coppice with reserve system, with the same rotation age. It produces root suckers, coppices and pollards well. The power to produce these vegetative shoots depends upon the climate and edaphic factors.
Seeds have poor viability; however, they can be stored dry in tins for not more than 6-9 months. There are 13 400-25 600 seeds/kg.

It is resistant to drought and resists fire better than other species in its zone of occurrence. The tree is also frost hardy and serves as a nurse tree for other species.
Natural propagation is usually good, even in the poorest of locations. Some regeneration is due to coppice and suckers, but the species also reproduces fairly well from seed. Mature seeds may be collected off the trees to facilitate artificial propagation. The seeds should be immersed in water before they are sown, to separate out the sterile pyrenes, which float on the surface. Seed germination takes between 7 and 15 days. B. serrata has the remarkable ability to sprout from large branch or stem cuttings.
The tree is a suitable species for afforestation on poorer soils in areas with a mean annual rainfall of 500-1 250 mm. It is valuable for reclothing dry sandstone hills which have been denuded of vegetation, where soil is markedly ferruginous and where complete protection against biotic factors is not always feasible. Under such circumstances, its ability to withstand the adverse effects of forest fires, its immunity to being browsed or lopped for fodder, its power of resisting the effects of insolation and drought, and its capacity for reproduction by seed, coppice and root suckers are great assets.
It is not readily browsed by cattle, although in India, it is considered a substitute fodder for buffaloes.
The wood is a good fuel. Charcoal made from it is particularly favoured for iron smelting.
Fibre:  B. serrata has recently come into prominence as a raw material for pulp paper and newsprint. Experiments show that writing and printing papers of suitable strength can be prepared when 25-40% long-fibred bamboo pulp is mixed in the finish. The bark can also be used for cordage.
Timber:  It is used in cheap furniture, ammunition boxes, mica boxes, packing cases, cement barrels, well construction, water pipes, matches, plywood and veneers.
Medicine:  The salai guggal gum is used as a diaphoretic and astringent.
Gum or resin:  The tree yields a yellowish-green gum-oleoresin known as ‘salai guggal’ from wounds in the bark. This gum has an agreeable scent when burnt. A mature tree yields about 1-1.5 kg of gum a year. It is said to be a good substitute for imported 
Ornamental:  It is popular for avenue planting in India."
Brachylaena huillensis,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (laeveldvaalbos), English (silver oak,low veld silver oak,low veld brachyleana), Swahili (mvumo,muhuhu,muhugu,mkarambati,mkalambaki), Trade name (muhuhu,muhugu)
Brachylaena huillensis grows to 35 m tall with a dbh of 85 cm under favourable conditions; fluted and often curved bole, which makes it difficult to obtain large dimensions of timber; bark grey, smooth or rough with longitudinal cracks.

Leaves entire or dentate, oblanceolate, up to 13 cm long and to 2.5 cm wide, grey felty beneath; apex acute; base long cuneate; petiole 1.2 cm long.

Capitula small, white, cylindrical, up to 2.5 cm long, in axillary woolly panicles; male capitula shortly pedicellate, with about 12 flowers; female capitula subsessile, with about 5 flowers; pappus in 1 row of scrabid bristles; flower heads white, in small terminal panicles or racemes; flowers tubular or discoid.

Fruit a small, winged achene in a white capitulum.

On the flowers, the bracts surrounding the discs are shorter than the flowers and are the basis of the generic name, which is based on Greek words meaning ‘short’ and ‘cloak’. The specific name means ‘of Huilla’, a place in Angola.
Ecology

In Kenya, B. huillensis is common in semi-deciduous tropical forests of the central highlands and the lowland dry coastal belts. It is also found in the northern forests of Tanzania.
Native range
Angola, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda
Tree management

The trees are easy to raise in plantations. On average, growth increment is fast on good soils.
Seed storage behaviour is uncertain; viability is lost within 6 months in open storage at room temperature. There are 333 000-500 000 seeds/kg.
In Kenya, B. huillensis is common in semi-deciduous tropical forests of the central highlands and the lowland dry coastal belts. It is also found in the northern forests of Tanzania.
B. huillensis is normally propagated by seed. Seeds from fruits collected only 7 days after the maturation of the buds will germinate.
During the 1st 2 decades of the 19th century, B. huillensis was the main fuel for Kenya. It was also exported as short logs to India as an inferior substitute for sandalwood for use in cremations. It is suitable for charcoal because of its high density, and is exploited for this in Kenya.
Timber:  The wood is pale yellow to pale brown, with characteristic storeyed structure, scented somewhat like sandalwood, straight grained with conspicuous growth rings; texture is very fine, even, strong and stiff. But its failure in bending is sudden and complete. It is hard to work but does turn and work well with sharp tools. It takes a high polish but splits easily along the grain. It is used in flooring, furniture and joinery. In Kenya, it is a favourite wood for carving artefacts.
Ornamental:  B. huillensis is planted as an ornamental tree around dwellings in Kenya.
Due to its durability, B. huillensis is used as fence posts, for example in northern Tanzanian along the border with Kenya, where it is overexploited.
Essential oil:  Oil distilled from the wood has a pleasant, vetiver-like perfume."

  The young leaves are edible and are also used in spicing and flavouring food.
Flowers, leaves and fruits are relished by all livestock, except horses and donkeys, particularly during the dry season. Camels are particularly fond of them and are the main consumers, since other species find it difficult to reach the foliage. Buffalo, black rhino and hartebeasts also seek the foliage. The fodder has a high protein content, 30%, and a digestibility in vitro value of 78%. C. farinosa also has a high ash content.
Provides fuelwood.
Shade or shelter:  Provides shade to small stock, goats and sheep.
Medicine:  Crushed leaves mixed with millet-flour are used as a medicine against coughs.
Can be used in constructing temporary fences for livestock.
Intercropping: Though it has shallow lateral roots, C. farinosa roots deeply. This implies that its intercropping potential could be average.
Other services: Preparations made from the plant are used in cleansing ceremonies in the Sudan."
Caesalpinia sappan,"Local names:
 Burmese (teing-nyet), English (false sandalwood,Indian brazilwood,Indian redwood,sappanwood), Filipino (sibukao,sapang), French (bois de sappan,sappan), Hindi (patungam,bokmo,bakan,patunga,vakum,vakam), Indonesian (secang,kayu sekang,kayu cang,soga jawa)
Caesalpinia sappan is a small to medium-sized, shrubby tree, 4-8(-10) m tall; trunk up to 14 cm in diameter; bark with distinct ridges and many prickles, greyish brown; young twigs and buds hairy, brownish.

Leaves stipulate, bipinnate, alternate, 20-45(-50) cm long, 10-20 cm broad, with 8-16 pairs of up to 20 cm long pinnae; pinnae with prickles at the base and with 10-20 pairs of oblong, 10-20 mm x 6-10 mm long, subsessile leaflets, very oblique at base, rounded to emarginated at apex.

The generic name is after A. Caesalpini, 1519-1603, Italian physician and botanist.
Ecology

Under natural conditions C. sappan grows mostly in hilly areas with clayey soil and calcareous rocks at low and medium altitudes. In Peninsular Malaysia it grows best on sandy riverbanks. It does not tolerate too wet soil conditions.
Native range
China, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand
Tree management

Initially C. sappan grows straight but at about 2.5 m height, the branches start to droop and entwine with branches of nearby trees to form thickets, generally free from undergrowth. After the tree is felled the stump sprouts profusely within 2 weeks. For use as dyewood the tree is harvested every 6-8 years and for firewood every 3-4 years when the trunk has attained 5-6 cm diameter. The tree is cut about 1 m above the ground to allow sprouts to grow from the stump.
Usually mature pods burst open in the dry season and scatter the seeds, which remain dormant until the start of the rainy season. Pods are gathered, pounded and put into cold water. After 2-3 hours the mixture is rubbed and mixed with a solution of iron sulphate. Seed germination occurs readily but is enhanced by dipping seeds wrapped in cotton cloth in boiling water for 5 seconds. Germination rate is then 90%.
Under natural conditions C. sappan grows mostly in hilly areas with clayey soil and calcareous rocks at low and medium altitudes. In Peninsular Malaysia it grows best on sandy riverbanks. It does not tolerate too wet soil conditions.
C. sappan is propagated by seed or cuttings which should be 2.5 cm diameter and 10 cm long.
The wood is used for firewood and its energy value is about 25 000 kJ/kg.
Timber:  The tree is the source of the commercial redwood or Brazilwood. Sapwood is white, heartwood makes up to 90 % of the total volume, is yellow or deep orange when fresh turning to dark red. The wood is straight grained with a fine to moderately fine texture, fairly heavy (600-780 kg/m³), hard and lustrous. It is difficult to dry and susceptible to warping and collapse, but moderately easy to work; it takes high finish and is tough and resistant to termite attack. It is used for inlaying work, cabinet making, violin bows and for walking sticks.
Tannin or dyestuff: The heartwood yields a valuable red crystalline dye, brazilin, used on cotton, silk and wool fabrics. Bakam gives bright red and violet shades, and with garcine produces a chocolate tint. Bark and pods yield similar dyes, pods contain ca. 40% tannin used for production of light leather goods. Roots give a yellow dye.
Medicine: A decoction of the wood is a powerful emmenagogue and, because of its tannic and gallic acids, is an astringent used in mild cases of dysentery and diarrhoea. It is also given internally for certain skin ailments. The sappan is given as a tonic to women after confinement and to relieve vomiting of blood. It is one of the ingredients in a mixture prescribed for malaria. The dried heartwood is widely used in oriental medicine, particularly against inflammation. Seeds serve as a sedative.
Gum or resin:  The stem produces a gum.
The tree is planted as a hedge and boundary marker in villages.
Essential oil:  Leaves contain a pleasant smelling volatile oil.
Other services: The leaves are used to hasten ripening of fruits such as bananas and mangoes."

Similar localities in North Africa and elsewhere are preferred ranging from warm temperate through tropical very dry to tropical wet forest zones.
Propagation is by seed. Seedlings are transplanted when 10 - 15 cm tall.
Poison:  The pods have high tannin content and may be lethal if consumed in large quantities by animals.
Seed germ (38 % C. spinosa seed weight) may be used as a source of protein in animal feeds once separated from the hull and endosperm.
Timber:  The wood is durable.
Shade or shelter:  The dense canopy of A. congensis makes it a good shade tree.
Tannin or dyestuff: C. spinosa pods contain 50% tannin, about twice as much as sumac (Rhus). The high content of hydrolysable tan has made it interesting for the extraction of gallic acid and ink manufacturing. The tannin is used on leather.
Medicine: The powder within pods is used as eyewash.
Gum or resin:  Seed endosperm (22 % seed weight) yields gum of commercial value. It is a white to yellowish powder and consists chiefly of galactomannan-type polysaccharides. C. spinosa gum is used as a thickening agent and stabilizer in the food industry
C. spinosa is sometimes grown as a live fence in Peru."

Inflorescence axillary from a single peduncle, terminating at the insertion of 1-2 pedicels or continuing for 1-3 additional nodes, rarely branching, usually slightly shorter than the leaves, mostly with 2-6 flowers; bracts about 5 mm long; flowers about 2 cm long; pedicels to about 9 mm long; calyx tube 3-5 mm long, glandular and pubescent, the upper lobe bifid, the lower lobe longest, about 4 mm long; vexillary petal basally inflexed biauriculate, mostly with reddish striate, bicallose in the target area, glabrous, about 14 mm long, with a claw about 4 mm long.

Fruit a pod, linear-oblong, apex obtuse or acute, compressed, bivalved, depressed between the seeds, about 4 cm long, 1 cm wide, 3-4 mm thick; upper suture swollen, the lower indistinct; beak downcurved; seeds 1-5, compressed, about 6 x 4 x 1.5 mm, of various colours; the hilum linear-oblong to somewhat elliptic, about 3 mm long.
Ecology

As the species is not found truly in the wild, its natural habitat conditions are uncertain. It prefers grassy habitats in tropical, cold-free zones with optimum 600-1000 mm annual rainfall. However, it grows in humid areas with 2500 mm annual rainfall and in semi-arid areas with only 400 mm of rain annually.
Native range
India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan
Tree management

For hedgerow intercropping, the hedges should be cut at height of 0.5-1 m when the grain crop is fully mature. The hedges can be cut 2-3 times a year in areas where the dry season lasts 4-6 months. At pod maturity, branches of C. cajan are cut at about 0.5 m. Higher levels of pruning can result in higher and unacceptable levels of plant mortality. As a field crop, C. cajan may be typified as rather undeveloped; the tall genotypes particularly are cumbersome in cultivation. Weeds must be controlled to alleviate slow initial growth. Wind may bend the plants, but staking is not practised. In intensive cropping of short-duration cultivars, irrigation may be required. C. cajan’s response to fertilizers is rarely economic; a phosphate dressing is generally recommended at 20-100 kg/ha.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox with no problems for long-term storage under preferred conditions. There are 5000-14 000 seeds/kg.
As the species is not found truly in the wild, its natural habitat conditions are uncertain. It prefers grassy habitats in tropical, cold-free zones with optimum 600-1000 mm annual rainfall. However, it grows in humid areas with 2500 mm annual rainfall and in semi-arid areas with only 400 mm of rain annually.
The pods are picked when the seed has reached physiological maturity and is just beginning to lose its bright green colour. C. cajan is best established by direct seeding in a well-prepared field. No pregermination treatment of seeds is needed. Seedlings have hypogeal germination. Emergence is complete 2-3 weeks after sowing. Stem cuttings rarely succeed.
Erosion control:  Extensively covering the ground with C. cajan prevents soil erosion by wind and water.
  The seeds of C. cajan can be used as a vegetable. Very young pods are harvested before the seeds are distinct and are cooked in curries or used to make relishes. The dry seeds have several products such as tempe (a traditional Indonesian food prepared by fermenting with a Rhizopus mould then soaked, dehulled and cooked legume seeds), and ketchup (pigeonpea sauce, a replacement for soy sauce in Indonesia that is made by fermenting C. cajan with Apergillus oryzae). C. cajan flour (mixed with wheat to improve the protein level of baked products) and clear noodles of a quality higher than that of mung bean are made from dehulled seed. Fresh seeds contain vitamins, especially provitamin A and vitamin B complex. Per a 100 g edible portion, dry seeds contain 7-10.3 g water, 14-30 g protein, 1-9 g fat, 36-65.8 g carbohydrates, 5-9.4 g fibre and 3.8 g ash. The energy content averages 1450 kJ/100 g.
C. cajan fodder alone may be a bit low in energy. The leaves can provide a good substitute for alfalfa in animal feed formulations, particularly in areas not suitable for alfalfa. The pods are used as cattle feed but are limited by their low protein and high fibre content. They have therefore been used as a roughage source for cattle. C. cajan grain has been successfully used for poultry feed. In Hawaii, a mixture of equal quantities of cracked pigeonpea and cracked maize has been proved the best poultry ration.
Apiculture:  Honeybees collect nectar from the plant, which is an important honey source. The honey has a distinctive greenish hue in the comb.
C. cajan sticks are an important household fuel in many areas. The heat value is about 1/2 that of the same weight of coal, and it has several advantages over traditional trees, such as its rapid growth potential, possibility of producing other crops on the same land, and production of a seed crop. Farmers sow it instead of grain because of its wood. Its productivity levels more than make up for the comparatively poor fuel characteristics.
Fibre: On an experimental basis, C. cajan has been found to produce a pulp for paper similar to that of hardwoods, and the pulp might be suitable for making good-quality writing and printing paper. The branches and stems can be used for making baskets.
Timber:  The wood is used in light construction such as in roofing, wattling on carts, tubular wickerwork lining for wells and baskets. 
Shade or shelter:  C. cajan is useful as a tall hedge on dry soil and on the bunds of paddy fields. It is often grown as a shade crop, cover crop or windbreak. 
Medicine:  It has many traditional uses as medicine. In Java, for example, the young leaves are applied to sores, herpes and itches.
Nitrogen fixing:  Using the nitrogen-balance method, it has been proved in northern India that long-duration C. cajan can fix up to 200 kg N/ha over a 40-week period.
In Southeast Asia, C. cajan is grown as a support for vanilla.
Soil improver:  The root system is reported to break plough pans, thus improving soil structure, encouraging infiltration, minimizing sedimentation and smothering weeds. Leaf fall at maturity adds to the organic matter in the soil and provides additional nitrogen. It seems to have special mechanisms to extract phosphorus from black Vertisol soils.
Intercropping:  Due to its hardiness, ability to grow on residual soil moisture, and slow early growth, C. cajan is an ideal, non-competitive crop to plant with cereals. In traditional cropping systems, it is mixed with cereals, oil seeds, short-season pulses or cotton, with the cereal as the main crop and C. cajan as the bonus crop. In Kenya, it is an important food legume, cultivated commercially for dry seed and as a green vegetable. In Zambia, smallholder farmers generally grow it in their backyards and around the fields of annual crops. In Uganda, it is combined with millet in a cropping system."
Calliandra calothyrsus,"Local names:
 English (red calliandra,kalliandra merah,calliandra), French (calliandre,calliandra), Indonesian (kaliandra), Malay (kaliandra), Spanish (palo de ángel,Cabello de ángel), Swahili (mkaliandra)
Calliandra calothyrsus is a small, thornless, often multistemmed shrub. Under optimum conditions it can attain a height of 12 m and a trunk diameter of 30 cm, but its average height is 5-6 m and diameter 20 cm. Bark colour varies from white to dark red-brown and is normally glabrous but occasionally can be finely pubescent. It has both superficial and deep-growing roots. Sometimes a taproot is formed.

Leaves alternate, petiolate, bipinnately compound, 10-19 cm long and without an upper waxy sheen. Pinnae vary in number from 6 to 20 pairs and possess 19-60 pairs of linear, acute or obtuse leaflets.

Flowers in a subterminal inflorescence with numerous long, hairlike stamens. Flowers and sepals green, staminal filaments purple or red.

Fruits broadly linear and flattened with a pod 8-13 cm long which breaks open, each half curling back to set free 3-15 shiny, black seeds. Pods 11-16 mm wide, long, attenuate to the base and sharply acute at the apex.

The generic epithet Calliandra is derived from 'calli' meaning beautiful and 'andra' for the male floral parts describes the beautiful and prominent anthers characteristic of this leguminous plant. The specific epithet describes the equally beautiful inflorescence of the species.
Ecology

Although originally described from Surinam, where it was probably introduced, C. calothyrsus is native to humid and subhumid Central America from southern Mexico to central Panama, 8-19 deg. N. 

The species occurs in secondary vegetation, often in thickets. It is an aggressive colonizer on disturbed sites such as recent landslides and roadsides. Best development occurs at moderate elevations below 1300 m. On Java, the species is planted up to 1500 m altitude, but it grows best between 250-800 m in areas with 2000-4000 mm annual rainfall and a 3-6 month dry period. Growth decreases on compacted soils and trees die after 2 weeks of oxygen depletion due to waterlogging.
Native range
Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama
Tree management

C. calothyrsus is fast growing, easy to regenerate and manage. Because seedlings grow quickly, no special plantation management is needed, except for weeding in the 1st year. On infertile soils, fertilizer will improve early growth, although C. calothyrsus is less responsive to fertilizer than other tree legumes. In alley-cropping systems, C. calothyrsus should be pruned in cycles or up to 4 months to limit shade on associated crops. Highest yields obtained from coppicing when cut at 1 m. With seedlings, root pruning and side pruning is recommended to keep taproot checked and to encourage lateral root development.
Orthodox storage behaviour; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 6-10% mc. There are approximately 19 000 seeds/kg.

Growth decreases on compacted soils and trees die after 2 weeks of oxygen depletion due to waterlogging.
Accepted methods include direct sowing and seedlings. C. calothyrsus is best established from seedlings simultaneously with crop planting. It can also be propagated from stem cuttings. The pretreatment procedure is to immerse in hot water, allow cooling and soaking for 12-24 hours, or soak in cold water for 24 hours, or seeds can germinate without pretreatment and be sown directly. Seed germination occurs after 4 days and continues for 21 days with most seed germinating between 10 and 25 days from sowing.
Erosion control: C. calothyrsus can be used to rehabilitate erosion-prone areas and recover land exhausted by agriculture, where it easily dominates undesired weeds such as Eupatrium spp., Saccharum spp., and Imperata cylindrica. 
Leaves and pods are rich in protein and do not contain any toxic substances. Protein content is 22% (dry matter) and annual fodder yield (dry matter) amounts to about 7-10 t/ha. The fodder can be given to all types of ruminants and fulfils 40-60% of their needs. Although no toxic substances have been found in the foliage, high concentrations of condensed tannins (up to 11%) have been reported, which may reduce the digestibility of protein for livestock to about 40%.  Freshly cut (4-6 hours) forage has a higher digestibility value (60-80%). For fodder production, spacing can be dense: 0.5 x 0.5 m to 0.75 x 0.75 m. In Asia, it is planted in rice field dikes to produce fodder for fish.
Apiculture:  Flowers contain nectar and because flowering lasts throughout the year bee keeping is profitable.  The honey produced by C. calothyrsus has a pleasant bitter sweet flavour. A production of one t of honey/ha has been reported.
A good firewood species because it is fast growing, multi-stemmed, easy to regenerate and thornless. One year after planting, annual wood yields have been reported in the order of 15-40 t/ha with annual coppice harvests continuing for 10-20 years. Yields from C. calothyrsus are extremely good in coppice; after being cut at 50 cm from the ground, 3 m high coppices are formed in only 6 months rotation. The rootstock is very vigorous and will sprout readily. For firewood, optimum spacing is 1 x 2 m with a minimum of 1 x 1 m. Returns from charcoal production are higher than fuelwood because the wood is a quick burner. C. calothyrsus can produce 14 t/ha of charcoal annually. Wood is suitable as a smoking fuel for the production of smoked sheet rubber. There has been a demand for smoking fuel since old rubber trees, the traditional source, are increasingly used by furniture manufacturers.
Fibre:  The pulp and papermaking properties of C. calothyrsus are satisfactory and are comparable to dipterocarps and appropriate for kraft paper manufacture. C. calothyrsus pulp is easily bleached, but wood dimensions are generally small, making handling and chipping difficult. The wood is also suitable for pulp and papermaking and is used in Asia. 
Shade or shelter: C. calothyrsus is often planted as a shade tree around houses. The dense foliage provides protective cover against sun and rain. In forestry it is used as a nurse tree for partially shade-tolerant timber trees such as Agathis species.
Nitrogen fixing:  Roots are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen because of the symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria (to which root nodules bear witness) and the symbiosis with root fungus.
Ornamental:  Its beautiful red ‘powder puff’ flowers make it an attractive ornamental.
Suitable for hedgerow boundaries.
Soil improver:  High leaf biomass production and high yields of protein leaf material on less fertile soils make it very suitable as a green manure and it is used in alley-cropping systems. Due to litter and the combination of a deep and well-developed lateral rooting system, the soil and productivity of the land is improved. However, the relatively high level of tannins present in its leaves slows the rate of microbial breakdown of the organic matter.
Intercropping: C. calothyrsus is compatible with crops, with both deep roots and extensive fibrous roots. It has shown promise as an understorey plant in coconut plantations with about 60% light transmission."
Calodendrum capense,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (wildekastaiing,kastaiinghout), English (wild chestnut,Cape chestnut), Trade name (Cape chestnut), Xhosa (umBaba), Zulu (umBhaba,umBaba)
In the forest, Calodendrum capense is tall, up to 20 m or more in height, but in open country and on the forest margin it is shorter and more spreading. Trunk is grey and smooth even in old trees and often buttressed and lichen covered in the forest. Branches are opposite, the young ones hairy and flexible, soon becoming smooth and more rigid.

Leaves simple, without stipules, opposite, untoothed, borne on short stalks, 5-13 (max. 22) x 3.5-7.5 cm; dark green, oval or oblong, aromatic, tips bluntly pointed or round, base tapering to slightly lobed, margin entire and rather wavy, midrib conspicuous on the undersurface. Parallel veins conspicuous, branching out almost at right angles from the midrib to the edge of the leaves; blades studded with oil glands appearing as tiny spots when the leaf is held to the light.

Flowers borne in rather open terminal sprays or panicles, bisexual; petals 5, long, narrow, hairy, 4 x 0.5 cm, curling downwards, with a faint sweet scent; alternating with 5 petallike stamens or staminodes, which are slender, graceful, longer than the petals, dotted with crimson or purple glandular dots, upright. Petals and staminodes together make a light, airy flower in shades of rich pink or mauve marked purple or wine red, very occasionally white; fertile stamens 5, with 5 white filaments, as long as the petals, bearing purple-brown anthers; ovary glandular, on a long gynophore.

Fruit knobbly, 5-valved, brown and woody capsule, 3.5-6 cm in diameter, containing several seeds. Seeds small, 1.5 cm long, angled, oily, jet black or black striped with white edge, smooth. 

The generic name comes from the Greek words ‘kalos’, meaning ‘beautiful’ and ‘dendron’, meaning ‘tree’; the specific name ‘capense’ means from the Cape.
Ecology

C. capense can be found growing in wooded ravines, in evergreen fringe forest, at the coast, sometimes in scrub. It is not restricted to any specific habitat. Trees in forests tend to have straight stems, sometimes buttressed, but trees growing in hot, dry valleys are low and gnarled with dark grey bark and small leaves and flowers. Well-established trees growing in favourable tree or bush groups can survive up to 8 degrees of frost. They can also grow in areas with bitterly cold winters but will not flower regularly. The hardy and drought-resistant trees occur naturally from Kenya in the north to the western Cape in the south. In Uganda, the species occurs only rarely in scattered patches of woodland in Mbarara District.
Native range
Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda
Tree management

C. capense is slow growing in most conditions; it coppices while young, and pollarding is a suitable practice. In warm areas with high rainfall, the growth rate can be up to 850 mm/year. Trees can be planted either in the shade or in full sun. They respond well to regular watering, and cut flowers are long lasting in water.
Seeds can be stored for up to a year if kept insect-free. There are about 600 seeds/kg.

The hardy and drought-resistant trees occur naturally from Kenya in the north to the western Cape in the south. In Uganda, the species occurs only rarely in scattered patches of woodland in Mbarara District.
Trees are easily cultivated from seed. Fresh seed can be sown in deep seedling trays filled with river sand. The seeds normally germinate in 10-40 days, with a germination rate of 80-90%. Germination may be erratic if old seeds are sown. The species can be propagated successfully from cuttings made from half-grown shoots, but they must be treated with a root-stimulating hormone. Young trees are easily planted out. Artificial propagation by wildings and seedlings is possible. Trees grown from seed will flower after 6-7 years, and those grown from cuttings after 4 years.
Apiculture:  Trees provide bee forage.
C. capense is suitable for firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  The timber is white or light yellow, sometimes with brown markings, and with little difference between sapwood and heartwood. It is fairly hard, moderately heavy (700-800 kg/cubic m), bends well and is easily worked. It is used for tent bows, wagon making, yokes, planking, shovel handles and furniture.
Shade or shelter:  Trees provide valuable shade and also act as windbreaks.
Ornamental: C. capense has a non-aggressive root system; at the coast, where it is evergreen, it is suitable for street and parking lot planting. It makes an attractive specimen tree, especially on a lawn, with its light grey bark, large leaves, masses of pink flowers and knobbly fruit.
Soil improver:  Leaf-fall is very heavy so trees provide mulch.
Intercropping: C. capense is grown in banana plantations.
Essential oil:  The kernel yields a lemon-yellow, rather bitter, fixed oil that can be used for making soap."
Calophyllum brasiliense,"Local names:
 English (false mamery,Brazil beauty-leaf), Portuguese (guanande), Spanish (santa maría,palo de maría,ocuje colorado,leche de maría,lagargo caspi,calaba,bari,alfaro,aceite maría), Trade name (santa maria,jacareuba)
Calophyllum brasiliense is a medium-sized, evergreen tree 12-20 m tall and 0.5 m or more in diameter, with a dense crown. Under favorable conditions the tree grows 30-45 m tall with long, straight clear trunk 1-1.8 m in diameter and no buttresses. The dense crown, abundant white flowers, brown fruits, and whitish latex can recognize María. The bark is light grey and smooth or slightly fissured, with numerous protuberances on large trunks; inner bark whitish and bitter.

Twigs green, 4-angled, minutely hairy when young, becoming grey. The leaves are opposite, stiff, elliptic, 6.3-12.5 cm long and 3.2-6.3 cm wide, dark green and shiny on the upper surface, with many straight parallel lateral veins at nearly right angles with the midrib. Petioles are 0.6-1.9 cm long, blades rounded or minutely notched at the apex, short pointed at the base, slightly leathery.

Flowers are numerous, small fragrant, white 1-1.3 cm wide in lateral branched racemes 2.5-5 cm long, male and bisexual on the same tree. There are 4 white rounded and concave sepals, 2 about 0.6 cm long and 2 about half as long, widely spreading and turned back. Petals commonly absent or 1-4, smaller than the largest sepals, white; male flowers with 4-50 stamens in a prominent orange cluster more than 0.6 cm across and often a rudimentary pistil. Sexual flowers with 8-12 stamens and pistils consisting of a round, green ovary 0.3 inches in diameter, one-celled with one ovule, short bent style and flattened whitish stigma.

The fruit is a 1-seeded brown drupe 2.5 cm in diameter.

The generic name comes from the Greek words ‘kalos’-beautiful and ‘phullon’-leaf, meaning beautiful-leafed and the specific epithet means 'of Brazil'.
Ecology

María is widely distributed throughout the West Indies. In Puerto Rico, it grows in the sub-tropical moist forest with ucas (Budica buceras), roble blanco(Tabebuia heterophylla), algarrobo (Hymenea courbaril) etc. In Nicaragua, the species is found in lowland evergreen rain forest with Andira inermis, Carapa nicaraguensis, Dialium guianense etc. In the lower montane rain forests of the Chiapas, Mexico, maría is one of the canopy trees.
Native range
Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guyana, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Puerto Rico
Tree management

Close spacings of 1.8 x 1.8 m or 1.5x 1.5 m are used to speed crown closures and prevent lateral branching. Weeding may not be necessary in dry areas. In wet areas, circular weeding 1 m around the tree should be done at least annually. Thinnings should be done more timely before the trees have been suppressed for so many years.
In Puerto Rico, seeds store for 1 year in a dry room germinated fairly well. Fruits should not be stored at a temperature below 0 deg C., and the water content of the fruit should not be lower than 35%.

Average germination is about 70%. Fresh seeds are sown directly into the soil. Seeds can be broadcast, if conditions are suitable, but plantations are usually established by planting seeds at a depth of 2.5 cm within 6 weeks if the endocarp is removed; seed with endocarp, which inhibits water uptake, may be broken with a hammer. Planting seedlings has been successful when the seedlings are moved with a ball of earth, and the best results have been observed in the rainy season. María only coppices when it is very young and it does not produce root suckers. Neither root nor shoot cuttings of maría have been successfully used for propagation.
The fruits are good food for hogs.
Timber:  The heartwood is pink or yellowish pink to brick red or rich reddish brown. Sapwood is lighter in color but not always clearly differentiated from the heartwood. The wood is rather difficult to air-season, and drying rate varies substantially. The wood is rather easy to work and usually yields smooth surface if straight grained but usually tears and chips if the grain is interlocked. It is below average in planing, turning and boring. The attractive wood is similar to mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and has comparable uses.
Shade or shelter:  In West Indies, maría is planted as a shade tree for coffee and cacao and for windbreaks.
Lipids:  oil has been extracted from the seeds.
Medicine:  The resin called balsámo de maría, has been used medicinally.
Ornamental: Its evergreen habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental and shade tree plantings.
Soil improver:  It has been used to stabilize soils and to relieve soil compaction in degraded pastures."
Calophyllum inophyllum,"Local names:

Calophyllum inophyllum is a medium-sized tree up to 25 m tall, sometimes as large as 35 m, with sticky latex either clear or opaque and white, cream or yellow; bole usually twisted or leaning, up to 150 cm in diameter, without buttresses. Outer bark often with characteristic diamond to boat-shaped fissures becoming confluent with age, smooth, often with a yellowish or ochre tint, inner bark usually thick, soft, firm, fibrous and laminated, pink to red, darkening to brownish on exposure. Crown evenly conical to narrowly hemispherical; twigs 4-angled and rounded, with plump terminal buds 4-9 mm long.

Leaves elliptical, thick, smooth and polished, ovate, obovate or oblong (min. 5.5) 8-20 (max. 23) cm long, rounded to cuneate at base, rounded, retuse or subacute at apex with latex canals that are usually less prominent; stipules absent. 

Inflorescence axillary, racemose, usually unbranched but occasionally with 3-flowered branches, 5-15 (max. 30)-flowered. Flowers usually bisexual but sometimes functionally unisexual, sweetly scented, with perianth of 8 (max. 13) petals in several whorls, usually whitish; petals 4; stamens numerous, yellow, grouped in 4 bundles, anthers changing from deep yellow through khaki to brown. Only the hermaphroditic flower has an ovary, a bright pink ball that is left at the end of the stem when the petals drop.

Fruit a spherical to ovoid drupe, 25-50 mm long, with a thin, compact outer layer, greyish-green in colour and smooth skinned. Stone with a hard layer and often with a spongy layer, containing a single seed. Seed with large cotyledons and radicle pointing to the base of the fruit.

The generic name comes from the Greek words ‘kalos’-beautiful and ‘phullon’-leaf, meaning beautiful-leafed and the specific epithet  is derived from the Greek words ‘is’-fibre and ‘phullon’-leaf, alluding to the pronounced veins on the underside of the leaves.
Ecology

C. inophyllum is essentially a littoral tree of the tropics, occurring above the high-tide mark along sea coasts of northern Australia and extending throughout Southeast Asia and southern India. It is common on sandy beaches of the seashore but is sometimes found inland on sandy soils.

It generally grows on the detritus brought down by rivers and on the sand and shingles banked up by wind and waves. The soil is generally dry at the surface, but the water table is usually only a few decimetres down, although the water it taps is often brackish. It is also found higher up the rivers along river margins.

The tree demands light; temperatures where it grows are moderated by the proximity of the sea and by the breezes. The sandy soil, exposed situation, radiation of heat from the sand, and salt-laden winds make the habitat pronouncedly xerophytic. C. inophyllum is sensitive to frost and fire.

Tree management

The tree is said to be brittle and liable to damage by wind. In Zanzibar, it is planted on coral areas, where it grows at about 90 cm of height a year after initial establishment, which is very slow; frequent weeding is necessary until the crop is established. In plantation trials in Indonesia, the spacing of seedlings is usually 2 x 3 m.  The species coppices moderately. The selective cutting system and removal of undesirable trees can enhance natural regeneration.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant; the seeds are very oily, quickly losing their germinative power. There are up to 200 seeds/kg.

Natural regeneration usually occurs near the mother tree. The rather woody fruit does not open, and the thick shell of the seed delays its germination. Germination under natural conditions may therefore be delayed for a considerable time until the rind has softened or rotted away. However, the tree can usually be grown from seed without difficulty, provided the seed is sown soon after ripening. Germination capacity is fair, and experiments conducted in the Philippines have shown that complete removal of the seed shell is very effective, both in reducing the average time taken for germination and in raising the germination capacity. As a result of this treatment, the germination period was reduced from 57 to 22 days and the germination percentage rose from 63% to 93%. Seedlings grown in a nursery require shade.
Poison:  The leaves, containing saponin and hydrocyanic acid, are poisonous to fish. The latex is rich in complex coumarin derivatives, some of which are piscicidal, while others are insecticidal. A considerable variety of xanthones is found in the wood and bark. One of the xanthones, called jacareubin, is nearly always present in Calophyllum but is extremely rare outside this genus.
 The fruit is edible; usually it is pickled but care must be taken with it, as it contains toxins.
Timber: C. inophyllum is a good general-purpose timber. In several regions, the wood is much sought after for masts, spars, bridgework and scaffolding because of the tall, slender form of the poles. Being close-grained and durable, the wood is used for boat building, railway sleepers, veneer and plywood; being of a rich reddish-brown, it is excellent for cabinet making. The wood is used for light construction, flooring, moulding, joinery, wooden pallets, diving boards, cartwheels and axles, musical instruments and blowpipes.
Shade or shelter:  The tree is planted for shade and for reforestation and afforestation. It also acts as an efficient shore protector in most places.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Tannins are commonly present, especially in the bark (11.9%) but often also in the leaves. A decoction of the bark is sometimes used to toughen and dye fishing nets. The seed oil and the latex have occasionally been used in dyeing batik cloth in Java. 
Lipids:  The kernels yield 50-73% of a bluish-yellow to dark green viscous oil, known as domba oil, or pinnai oil, or dilo oil. It has a disagreeable taste or odour, as it contains some resinous material that can easily be removed by refining. The concentration of resinous substances in the oil varies from 10 to 30%; it may therefore be used as a varnish. Domba oil is of excellent quality for soap manufacture; it is also used as an illuminant and in local medicine. The main compounds of the seed oil are oleic, linoleic, stearic and palmitic acid. Mixed with resin of Vateria indica, the oil is used for caulking boats.
Medicine:  Oil extracted from the fruit is employed as a remedy for rheumatism, ulcers and skin diseases. Bark is said to be an astringent. A decoction of the bark and latex is used medicinally: internally against diarrhoea and after childbirth, externally against skin and eye diseases and rheumatism. Leaves, flowers and seeds are sometimes also used in local medicine.
Ornamental:  Although slow growing, C. inophyllum is a popular tree for roadside and avenue planting in India. It is a handsome ornamental, the young foliage being crimson and the flowers scented.
Soil improver:  Remains of the pressed seeds (oil cake) can probably be used as a manure."
Calotropis procera,"Local names:
 Amharic (tobiaw,ghinda,qimbo), Arabic (dead sea plant,usher,kisher), English (calotrope,calotropis,Dead Sea fruit,desert wick,giant milkweed,swallow-wort,mudar fibre,rubber bush,rubber tree,sodom apple), French (pomme de Sodome,algodón de seda,arbre á so
Calotropis procera is a shrub or small tree up to 2.5 m (max. 6) high, stem usually simple, rarely branched, woody at base and covered with a fissured, corky bark; branches somewhat succulent and densely white tomentose; early glabrescent. All parts of the plant exude a white latex when cut or broken.

Leaves opposite, simple, subsessile, stipule absent; blade oblong-obovate to broadly obovate, 5-30 x 2.5-15.5 cm, apex abruptly and shortly acuminate to apiculate, base cordate, margins entire, succulent, white tomentose when young, later glabrescent and glaucous.

Inflorescence a dense, multiflowered, umbellate cyme arising from the nodes and appearing axillary or terminal; flowers hermaphroditic, pentamerous; pedicle 1-3 cm long; calyx 5-lobed, shortly united at the base, lobes ovate, 4-7 x 3-4 mm, glabrescent.

Fruit, a simple, fleshy, inflated, subglobose to obliquely ovoid follicle up to 10 cm or more in diameter; seeds numerous, flat obovate, 6 x 5 mm, with silky white pappus 3 cm or more long.

The specific name, procera is Latin for tall or high.
Ecology

C. procera is drought-resistant, salt-tolerant to a relatively high degree, and through its wind and animal dispersed seeds, it quickly becomes established as a weed along degraded roadsides, lagoon edges and in overgrazed native pastures. Has a preference for and is often dominant in areas of abandoned cultivation especially sandy soils in areas of low rainfall; assumed to be an indicator of over-cultivation.

Tree management

C. procera has been cultivated in South America and on the Caribbean Islands for the production of fibres at a spacing of 1-1.5 m. When cultivated, annual yields of up to 500 kg/ha are expected. A single harvest per season is preferable to a double (or triple) harvest; a single harvest would result in a net saving of energy input both on the farm and in the processing plant. Well suited for intensive energy farming in arid or semi-arid regions where frost is not a limiting factor.
Seed storage behavoiur is orthodox.

Has a preference for and is often dominant in areas of abandoned cultivation especially sandy soils in areas of low rainfall; assumed to be an indicator of over-cultivation.
The tree seeds freely, and natural regeneration is common. Vegetative propagation through half stumps assumes a special importance as compared with the entire stumps because they help in faster multiplication of the parent genotype with plus characters, as each plant gives rise to 2 half stumps. Stumps also help in propagating only 1 plant. Vegetative propagation through stem and root cuttings is very useful in large-scale multiplication of the superior genotypes.
Poison:  The bark and the latex are widely used as arrow and spear poisons. The latex is cardiotoxic with the active ingredient being calotropin. Latex of C. procera is 80% effective in inhibiting the activity of the tobacco mosaic virus. The leafy branches are said to deter ants. 
  The bark and latex are used in brewing and to curdle milk.
Young pods, senescing leaves and flowers are eaten by goats, occasionally by sheep in times of need, and rarely by cattle and other livestock because they are slightly toxic. Nutritional analysis of shade-dried leaves of C. procera shows they contain 94% dry matter, 43% acid detergent fibre, 20% ash, 19% crude protein, 19% neutral detergent fibre, 5% magnesium, 2% oil, 0.59% phosphorus, 0.2% zinc, 0.04% iron and 0.02% calcium.
Stems produce a good charcoal, while the stem pith makes good tinder. Produces an effective and sustained smoky fire, suitable for drying fish. Charcoal has been used for gunpowder in India.
Fibre:  White, silky, strong, cylindrical, flexible and durable stem fibre used for various purposes, such as for making ropes, to form cheap cots, gunny bags, bow strings, fishing nets, and in the manufacture of paper, pulp and duplicating stencils. The floss from the seeds, which is about 2-3.5 cm long, white silky and strong, is used as an inferior stuffing for mattresses and pillows as well as for weaving into a strong cloth. The floss may also substitute cotton wool for surgical purposes. Strong inner bark fibres produce a binding material and are processed into fabrics. 
Timber:  Stems are termite proof and used for roofing and building huts. The very light wood can also be used for fishing net floats. 
Tannin or dyestuff:  A macerated bark extract can be used for dehairing hides and tanning. Additional minor uses includes dyes. 
Medicine:  Compounds derived from the plant have been found to have emeto-cathartic and digitalic properties. The principal active medicinals are asclepin and mudarin. Other compounds have been found to have bactericidal and vermicidal properties. The latex contains a proteolytic enzyme called caloptropaine. An infusion of bark powder is used in the treatment and cure of leprosy and elephantiasis. It is inadvisable to use bark that has been kept for more than a year. The root bark is an emetic, the flower a digestive, and a tonic is used for asthma and catarrh. Bark and wood stimulate lactation in cattle. Roots (extremely poisonous) are applied for snakebite. The milky sap is used as a rubefacient and is also strongly purgative and caustic. The latex is used for treating ringworm, guinea worm blisters, scorpion stings, venereal sores and ophthalmic disorders; also used as a laxative. Its use in India in the treatment of skin diseases has caused severe bullous dermatitis leading sometimes to hypertrophic scars. The local effect of the latex on the conjunctiva is congestion, epiphora and local anaesthesia. The twigs are applied for the preparation of diuretics, stomach tonic and anti-diarrhoetics and for asthma. Also used in abortion, as an anthelmintic, for colic, cough, whooping cough, dysentery, headache, lice treatment, jaundice, sore gums and mouth, toothache, sterility, swellings and ulcers.
Soil improver:  A source of green manure. The plant can help improve soil water conditions and also acts as a soil binder.
Latex or rubber:  The liquid latex of C. procera can be used as a renewable source of hydrocarbons and intermediate energy resources. Latex contains 11-23% of rubber.
Other services:  A suitable indicator of exhausted soil.
Pollution control:  C. procera is an ideal plant for monitoring sulphur dioxide emissions in the air."
Cananga odorata,"Local names:
 Burmese (sagasein,kadatngan,kadatnyan), English (perfume tree,ylang-ylang), Filipino (ilang-ilang,alang-ilang), Hindi (chettu sampangi,karumugai), Khmer (sreng,chhke), Malay (kenanga utan), Thai (kradanga-ton,kradangnga-thai), Trade name (perfume tree,sa
Cananga odorata is a small to large forest tree to 40 m tall and about 45 cm in diameter with a straight stem, an irregularly-shaped crown and a sometimes drooping, brittle branch formation. When grown for perfume extraction, it is normally not more than 3 m tall. The trunk is generally cylindrical in shape up to the first branch and without buttresses. The bark is smooth, pale grey to silvery.

Leaves simple, alternate, 13-29 cm by 4-10 cm, arranged in two ranks, simple and without stipules, puberulent below, medium green; the stalk is slender, 1-2 cm long, narrowly grooved above and smooth; the leaf blade is ovate-oblong and the base is often of unequal sides, sometimes rounded or heart-shaped, the margins are more or less wavy, the midrib and lateral veins are whitish hairy on both sides.

Inflorenscence a raceme, 1-4 cm long, with 2-6 flowers on short, leafless, axillary shoots. Flowers bisexual, axillary, 5-7.5 cm long, dull green and turning yellowish with age; pedicel 2-5 cm long; stamens numerous, 2-3 mm long; ovaries several to many, free, style oblong and slender.

Fruit pendulous, consisting of many (7-16) separate, globose-obovoid monocarps, about 25 mm by 15 mm on stalk 10-20 mm long; monocarp dark green becoming blackish when ripe, 2-12-seeded with seeds embedded in yellowish oily pulp arranged in 2 rows.

Seeds flattened, ellipsoid, 9mm by 6 mm by 2.5 mm, pale brown, surface pitted, hard, with a rudimentary aril.
Ecology

Cananga odorata grows well in more humid lowland tropics or moist valleys, sometimes with other evergreen and teak trees. It prefers well light places, fertile sandy loam and volcanic soils. In Java it grows gregariously in moist evergreen forest and in teak forest.
Native range
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Direct sowing is common. Seeds are placed 5 cm deep in well-cultivated and fertilized planting pits of at least 50 cm depth. Plant spacing is at least 6 m by 6 m. Young plantations are often intercropped with food crops. Ring weeding and slashing of the inter-rows are important for optimal growth. For ylang-ylang production, trees are usually topped at about 3 m after 2-3 years. Topping promotes the growth of low, drooping branches, which are also tied down to pegs to keep the flowers within easy reach. A well managed plantation may remain productive for 50 years
Seed storage behaviour is  orthodox
Cananga odorata grows well in more humid lowland tropics or moist valleys, sometimes with other evergreen and teak trees. It prefers well light places, fertile sandy loam and volcanic soils. In Java it grows gregariously in moist evergreen forest and in teak forest.
Normally propagated by seeds or wilding and rarely by cuttings. Fresh seed germinates erratically but higher after 6-12 month storage. Hot water treatment of seed is used successfully. Plants may be raised in nursery beds, but should be handled with great care during transplanting to avoid damage to the long taproot. Vegetative propagation by stem cutting and budding has been tried with varying success
 The oil is sometimes used in food and beverages.
The wood is occasionally used for fuelwood
Fibre: In Indonesia, they make ropes out of beaten bark.
Timber: The timber is used for local construction, building canoes and matches.
Shade or shelter: Ylang-ylang is mainly planted as a roadside shade tree.
Medicine: The essential oil from the flowers contains caryophyllene, used to treat hepatitis and has a wide range of medicinal applications. The seeds may be used to treat fever. In Indonesia, the flowers are used against malaria and leaves are rubbed on skin to treat itchiness. Dried flowers and bark are also used medicinally. The oil has a euphoric and sedative effect on the nervous system; it can help with anxiety, tension, shock, fear and panic. Its aphrodisiac qualities may be of use in impotence and frigidity. The oil could have a soothing effect on the skin and its stimulating effect on the scalp could promote more luxurious hair growth
Ornamental: It is widely planted in home gardens and roadsides as an ornamental.
Intercropping: It is usually cultivated in backyards and gardens together with other crops.
Essential oil: Cananga odorata flowers (also leaves and fruits) yield an important essential oil (contain 1-2% volatile oil) widely used in perfume manufacture. Subsequent extracts are used in soap, cosmetics and other hygienic by-products.
Other services: In Indonesia, Ylang ylang flower petals are strewn upon the bed on wedding nights. During town festivities, it is popularly given as leis to guests and offered in religious ceremonies"
Canarium indicum,"Local names:
 English (red canariun,pili nut,java almond,canarium nut), French (noix de kanari,la nangaile), Indonesian (lawele,galip), Malay (upi,seladah,kerantai), Tamil (rata kekuna)
Canarium indicum is an evergreen, dioecious, medium-sized to fairly large tree to 40 m tall and a diameter of up to 100 cm. The crown is large, dense crown and buttresses are upto  m high. The bark is grey or brownish-grey to yellow-brown, smooth to scaly and dippled; inner bark laminated, reddish-brown to pinkish-brown, exuding a milky resin.

Leaves imparipinnate, arranged spirally with 7-15 opposite leaflets; leaflets oblong, 13.5-36 by 4.4-21 cm, base rounded and slightly asymmetrical, apex acuminate, margin entire, glabrous; petiole 9 cm long. The stipule ovate to oblong, persistent, large and prominently dentate, rarely inserted on the petiole.

Inflorescence terminal or axillary, broadly paniculate, 15-30 cm long; flowers numerous, creamy white, 3 merous; male flower 10 mm long, stamens 6, female ones up to 15 mm long.

Fruit blue-black drupe, 35-60 mm by 15-30 mm, endocarp hard, thin and brittle, ovoid, circular to slightly triangular in cross-section, glabrous, and in groups of 6-12.

Seeds brown, 3.5 by 2 cm, oily, palmatifid to 3 foliolate and variously folded cotyledons.

The family Burseraceae consists of 16 genera and about 550 species in the tropical regions of both hemispheres. The genus Canarium (derived from the Malay name ‘kanari’, the local name for one of the species), contains about 75 species of trees which are mainly found in tropical Asia and the Pacific, and a few species in tropical Africa.
Ecology

C. indicum occurs in primary and secondary rain forest on both well drained and poorly drained sites but is uncommon in grasslands.
Native range
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, Vanuatu, Vietnam
Tree management

C. indicum trees are planted at a spacing of about 9 m in the Solomon Islands. In these plantations trials, the growth rates averaged 2.8 m/year in height and 3 cm/year in diameter. A total of two seedlings should be set in a hole, and all male trees should be cut down as soon as their sex can be determined, leaving only one male tree for every 20-25 female trees.

Little is known about the cultural requirements of the tree. Marcots usually form lateral branches early and do not require training. Seedling, grafted and budded trees initially tend to grow upright and need to be trained at an early age to induce the formation of lateral branches. This is done by pinching off the terminal bud when the tree is about 0.5-1 m tall. This should be done repeatedly on all the subsequent shoots, until the youngest set of shoots becomes reproductive, a process that may take 5-6 years. Once the tree starts fruiting, very little pruning is necessary.

Mature trees yield at least 100 kg/year of fruits when open grown and under plantation conditions they can be expected to yield 7700 kg/ha of fruits annually (the kernels account for about 15% of the total weight)
C. indicum occurs in primary and secondary rain forest on both well drained and poorly drained sites but is uncommon in grasslands.
C. indicum is usually propagated through seed and seedlings, or by asexual methods, such as marcotting, grafting and budding. Vegetative propagation methods like budding and grafting are practiced for the fruit production. Marcotting, or air-layering is the simplest propagation method for this species. However, it is a very slow process, both in terms of the time it takes to root the branches and the number of propagules that can be produced from one tree.

When grafting, the seedling rootstocks need to be established in large black polybags (at least 25 cm x 35 cm) or directly in the field, so that they attain sufficient stem girth faster, to match the diameter of the terminal shoots to be used as scions. It is better to use previously defoliated shoots as scions. Grafting is suitable done in the cool and dry months of November to February
 The oily nuts (seeds) are eaten raw or roasted as a dessert after the removal of testa .The fresh seed oil is mixed with food. Nut contains 70-80% oil, 13% protein and 7% starch. The young shoot is edible and can be used in cooking and in making green salads.
The resin-rich wood is soft and makes an excellent firewood. The hard, stony shell of the seed is chiefly used in cooking, for which it makes an excellent fuel.
Timber: The wood density is 500-650Kg/m3 at 12% moisture content. The wood is used for light construction, mouldings, house-framing, interior finish and canoes construction.
Shade or shelter: It makes an excellent roadside or avenue and border tree, and a verdant shade tree for lawns.
Lipids: Oil extracted from the seeds serves as a substitute for coconut oil for cooking or as an illuminant. Oil distilled from it is an ingredient in perfume and cosmetics.
Medicine: The bark is used in traditional medicine for treatment of vomiting, and the young leaves for the treatment of scabies and ciguatera poisoning.
Gum or resin: A lemon-scented pale yellow resin is collected from incisions made in the bark is used in incense. It is also used as an ingredient in plasters and ointments.
Its remarkable resistance to strong winds makes it a good living windbreak for other crops such as bananas and papayas.
Intercropping: The tree is cultivated in home gardens together with other crops."
Canarium ovatum,"Local names:
 English (pilinut,Philippine nut,canarium melioides), Filipino (pili-pilauai,pili,pilaui,liputi,basiad,anangi), Trade name (pili,Kedongdong)
Canarium ovatum is an attractive, symmetrically shaped evergreen tree, up to 20 m tall and 50 cm in diameter. Stipules persistent, deltoid to lingulate, 5-20 x 3-10 mm.

Leaves 2-4-jugate, imparipinnate, spirally arranged, about 40 cm long; leaflets ovate to elliptic, 4-24 x 2-12 cm, stiff, coriaceous, entire, base oblique, rounded to subcordate, apex abruptly acuminate, 8-12 pairs of nerves. 

Inflorescence axillary, close together at the ends of branches, narrowly thyrsoid, 3-12 cm long, few flowers; flowers trimerous, unisexual, subsessile, pubescent, up to 12 mm long, calyx cupular, 7 mm long in male, 8-9 mm in female flowers; petals 2 x 1 cm; stamens 6, slightly adnate to the disk and sterile in female flowers; pistil absent in male flowers, 7 mm long in female. 

Fruit drupaceous, ovoid to ellipsoid, 3.5-6.25 x 2-2.75 cm, acute, triangular in cross-section; exocarp thin, glabrous, shiny, turning from light green to purplish-black; mesocarp fibrous, fleshy, thick and greenish-yellow in colour; endocarp (shell) elongated, stony, trigonous, pointed at base, blunt or obtuse at apex, tawny to dirty brown, sterile cells strongly reduced. Seed with 1 brown papery seed coat. Much of the kernel weight is made up of the cotyledons, which are about 4.1-16.6% of the whole fruit. 

The genus name Canarium comes from the vernacular name ‘kenari’ in the Molucca Isles.
Ecology

Pili is a tropical tree preferring warm temperatures and well-distributed rainfall. It cannot tolerate the slightest frost or low temperature. In its natural habitat it grows at low to medium altitudes in primary and secondary forests. Mature trees can resist strong winds.
Native range
Philippines
Tree management

Production is mainly from wild trees and small plantings near coconut and hemp plantations. Most of the production in the Philippines is from seedling-raised trees; there is much variation in kernel quality and quantity between the trees. A mature pili tree yields between 100-150 kg of unshelled nuts.
Refrigeration of seeds at 4-13 deg. C results in loss of viability after 5 days. Nuts in the shell, with 2.5-4.6% mc, can be stored in the shade for 1 year without deterioration of quality. Seed germination is highly recalcitrant, reducing from 98 to 19% after 12 weeks of storage at room temperature; seeds stored for more than 137 days did not germinate.
Pili is a tropical tree preferring warm temperatures and well-distributed rainfall. It cannot tolerate the slightest frost or low temperature. In its natural habitat it grows at low to medium altitudes in primary and secondary forests. Mature trees can resist strong winds.
Most C. ovatum kernels tend to stick to their shell when fresh but come off easily after being dried to 3-5% mc (30 deg. C for 27-28 hours). Pericarp is also removed by dipping fruits in hot water. The seedlings take 40-50 days to emerge; year-old seedlings can be used for rootstock. Asexual propagation is best through patch budding, which has a claimed success rate of 85-90% in the Philippines. Cleft grafting is also successful; marcotting is too inconsistent to be used for propagation in commercial production and may be cultivar dependent.
  The most important product from C. ovatum is the kernel. When raw, its flavour resembles roasted pumpkinseed, and when roasted, its mild, nutty flavour and tender, crispy texture are superior the almond. It has been recorded that the testa should be removed before the kernel is eaten, because it causes diarrhoea. Pili kernel is also used in chocolate, ice cream and baked goods. Nutritionally, the kernel contains 71.1% fat, 11.4% protein and 8.4% carbohydrates; it is high in calcium, phosphorus and potassium. The kernel is a major ingredient in a famous Chinese festive dessert known as the ‘moon cake’. However, kernels from some trees may be bitter, fibrous or have a turpentine odour. Young shoots are used in salads, and the fruit pulp is eaten after it is boiled and seasoned. Boiled pili pulp resembles the sweet potato in texture, it is oily (about 12%) and is considered to have food value similar to the avocado. Pulp oil can be used for cooking.

The hard and thick shell that encloses the kernel makes an excellent fuel for cooking. The resin-rich wood makes good firewood.
Shade or shelter:  The evergreen C. ovatum tree makes an excellent windbreak as it resists strong winds and even typhoons.
Lipids:  An edible light-yellow oil expressed from the kernel is comparable in quality to that of olive oil, containing up to 59% oleic glycerides and 32-59% of palmitic glycerides. Pulp oil can be extracted and used as a substitute for cottonseed oil in the manufacture of soap and edible products. 
Medicine:  Resin is soft, odorous and has the texture of honey. It was formerly exported for the European pharmaceutical trade as Manila or Philippine gum elemi for use as an ointment for healing wounds and as a plaster. Raw nuts are a purgative.
Gum or resin:  A valuable resin, called Manila elemi or ‘breabianca’, is used as an ingredient in the manufacture of plastics, printing inks and perfumes. It is also is used by the Spaniards for ship repairs. 
Ornamental:  With its symmetrical branches, C. ovatum is an attractive avenue tree.
Soil improver:  Stony shells are excellent as a porous, inert growth medium for orchids and anthuriums."
Canarium schweinfurthii,"Local names:
 English (purple canary tree,incense tree,gum resin tree,bush candle tree,African elemi), French (elemier d’Afrique,elemi de Moahum,elemi d’ouganda), Luganda (muwafu), Swahili (mpafu,mbani), Trade name (white mahogany,African canarium)
Canarium schweinfurthii is a large forest tree with its crown reaching to the upper canopy of the forest, with a long clean, straight and cylindrical bole exceeding 50 m.  Diameter above the heavy root swellings can be up to 4.5 m. Bark thick, on young tree fairly smooth, becoming increasingly scaly and fissured with age. The slash is reddish or light brown with turpentine like odour, exuding a heavy, sticky oleoresin that colours to sulphur yellow and becomes solid.

Leaves are pinnate, clustered at the end of the branches, and may be 15-65 cm long, with 8-12 pairs of leaflets, mostly opposite, oblong, cordate at base, 5-20 cm long and 3-6 cm broad, with 12-24 main lateral nerves on each side of the mid-rib, prominent and pubescent beneath. The lower leaflets are bigger than the upper ones. The lower part of the petiole is winged on the upper side.

The creamy white unisexual flowers about 1 cm long grow in inflorescences that stand in the axils of the leaves and may be up to 28 cm long.

The fruit is a small drupe, bluish-purple, glabrous, 3-4 cm long and 1-2 cm thick. The calyx is persistent and remains attached to the fruit. The fruit contains a hard spindle-shaped, trigonous stone that eventually splits releasing 3 seeds.

Canarium comes from the vernacular name ‘kenari’ in the Molucca Isles.

C.schweinfurthiii is distributed throughout tropical Africa in rain forest, gallery forest and transitional forest from Senegal to west Cameroon and extending to Ethiopia, Tanzania and Angola.
Native range
Angola, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia
Tree management

This tree is amenable to mixed culture plantation husbandry.
The ripe fruits should be collected when they fall to the ground and allowed to decompose, the stones should then be separated from the outer fruit coats. Seeds can be stored for a long time.
C.schweinfurthiii is distributed throughout tropical Africa in rain forest, gallery forest and transitional forest from Senegal to west Cameroon and extending to Ethiopia, Tanzania and Angola.
The tree is propagated through seedlings, wildings and direct sowing on site. The seeds should be immersed in hot water and allowed to cool then soaked for 24 hours before sowing.
Poison:  The resin is used as a fumigant against mosquitoes.
The tree has been planted for reforestation in Uganda.
 The slightly greenish outer pulp of the fruit is oily and edible. It can be eaten raw or softened in warm water to improve palatability. The pulp oil is about 71 % palmitic acid and 18 % oleic acid. The seed-kernel is oily and edible. They are cooked, and in Nigeria, sometimes prepared into a vegetable-butter and eaten as a substitute for shea-butter. They contain several fatty acids including oleic (36 %), linoleic (28 %), palmitic (26 %), stearic (7 %).
The elemi makes a good fuelwood, igniting readily and burning with a lot of heat. The resin burns readily and is used as a bush candle.
Timber: The sapwood, often very thick up to 15 cm is white with pinkish reflections. The heartwood is pinkish when fleshly cut but darkens to light brown mahogany colour. The wood, slightly coarse in texture, has interlocked grains, thus causing a fine striped figure on quarter-sawn boards. Used as a substitute for true mahogany, it seasons slowly but fairly well, works easily, stains and polishes well. End splitting may occur during the drying process. The wood is attacked by termites and fungi. Impregnation of the heartwood is difficult.  The timber is used as core veneer, for decorative paneling, parquetry, furniture, flooring and for general utility purposes. Locally, the wood is used for mortars, planks, and canoes.
Shade or shelter: The elemi is often left standing on cleared land to provide shade and has potential as a wind break.
Medicine:  In the past, the resin was exported to Europe for pharmaceutical use. It was used as a substitute for gum-mastic in making wound dressings in World War II. A bark decoction is used against dysentery, gonorrhea, coughs, chest pains, pulmonary affections, stomach complaints, food poisoning, and it is purgative and emetic. The resin is used against roundworm infections and other intestinal parasites. It is an emollient, stimulant, diuretic and has action on skin-affections and eczema. The pounded bark is used against leprosy and ulcers. Root is used against adenites whereas root scrapings are made into a poultice.
Gum or resin: The bark exudes a heavy, sticky oleoresin that smells like turpentine and solidifies to a whitish resin. It is obtained by slashing the bark and allowing the colourless expiation to trickle to the ground where it solidifies into a sulphur-ye
Ornamental:  The trees’ symmetrical branching makes it an attractive avenue and shade tree.
Intercropping:  The tree does not compete with crops and has potential for intercropping.
Essential oil:  The resin contains 8-20 % of an essential oil, the main constituent of which is limonene. It is rich in phellandrenes, and contains also resins and a bitter principle"
Capparis decidua,"Local names:
 Arabic (tundub,sodad,murkheit,kursan), French (caprier sans feuilles,caprier), Hindi (karir,karil), Somali (meringa)
Capparis decidua is a bushy shrub in dense tufts, 4-5 m high, or occasionally a small tree with many green vine-like apparently leafless branches, hanging in bundles. Bark turns whitish-grey colour with age, but most branches and twigs are a glossy dark green. Small, light brown spines occur in pairs on the twigs at each node.

Leaves very minute (2 mm long), with a very short life span on young shoots, so that the plant looks leafless most of the time. 
Flowers pink, red-veined, in small groups along the leafless shoots, in the axils of the spines.

Fruit a small many-seeded ovoid or sub-globulous, slightly mucronate pink berry of the size and shape of a cherry, becoming blackish when dry.

The generic name is derived from the Arabic 'kapar', the name for Capparis spinosa.
Ecology

This species is common in dry tropical Africa, especially in the Sahel, where it sometimes constitutes lines of small trees in Wadi beds, as in Mauritania for instance. In West Africa, the area of distribution is identical to that of Cadaba farinosa; its southern limit corresponds to the northern loop of the Senegal river. In the Republic of Niger it reaches the Konadougou. Its area includes Tibesti (West Chad), much of the Sudan (except the extreme South) the Arabian Peninsula, Jordan, India, Pakistan, Iran, the Mascarene Islands and Natal.

It is tolerant to prolonged drought and an interesting plant by reason of its excellent adaptation to arid conditions.

Vegetative propagation is by cuttings or tissue culture. Direct sowing, planting stock and wildings have also been used.
Erosion control:  C. decidua has been found to be one of the best species for shelter belts to check the movement of sand in the Thar desert, India (Pandey and Rokad, 1992).
  The fruit is relished by camels and also, wherever within their reach, by goats. The fruits are also consumed by man in the Sudan.
Its browse value is probably its most important asset, despite being low in nutritional value. In Sudan for instance, it is a major source of camel food as it can be eaten when little else is available.
It is used for charcoal and firewood in its native range.
Timber:  The wood is very hard and used to make water pipes and water troughs.
Shade or shelter:  One of its preferred uses in the Sudan is as a shade and shelterbelt (Vogt, 1995).
Medicine:  The very bitter roots are used in the Indian and Farsi pharmacopoeia and the root bark is used to cure swollen joints.
As it is drought resistant and withstands neglect, this species could be particularly useful in arid areas as a live hedge providing edible fruits."
Capparis tomentosa,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (wollerige kapperbos), Amharic (gumero), Arabic (sharube), English (woolly caper-bush), French (caprier d? Afrique), Shona (khawa), Somali (gombor lik), Swahili (mbada paka), Tigrigna (andel)
Capparis tomentosa is often a spiny scrambler or a small tree that grows up to 10 m tall, with an upright trunk up to 13-15 cm in diameter and covered with scattered spines. Trees are well branched and branches are normally covered with thick yellow hairs; even the robust, recurved spines are often hairy.

Leaves soft and velvety, light green to greyish-green, sometimes rusty coloured, alternate, 2.5-8 cm long, 1.3-3.8 cm wide, oval, oblong, or egg shaped, usually thickly velvet but sometimes smooth; tip usually rounded with a sharp, short point, sometimes notched or blunt; base rounded or narrowed; margin entire and rolled under. Spines grow in the axils of the leaves and are short, downward hooked and sharply pointed, broad based and vicious. Petiole up to 10 mm long, densely velvety.

Buds grow in clusters and open into large, fragrant flowers with pale yellowish-green petals, up to 3.5 cm in diameter, encircling a tuft of long, slender, white or pink stamens 3.5 cm long; conspicuous gynophore.

The flowers develop into pendulous fruits from the size of a cherry to that of a golf ball, with a stout neck or stalk, globose, 3.5 cm in diameter, pink to bright orange when ripe, often hanging in great numbers, with a semi-transparent bluish-grey flesh surrounding and strongly adhering to the brown seeds. Seeds are oval and smooth.

The generic name is derived from the Arabic 'kapar', the name for Capparis spinosa. The specific name ‘tomentosa’ means ‘densely hairy’ in reference to the hairiness of the leaves and branches.
Ecology

The species grows from Natal, Swaziland, Transkei, Zululand, and eastern and northern Transvaal, westward across Botswana into northern Namibia, and northwards into tropical Africa. It occurs in coastal bush, forests, riverbanks, mountain slopes, evergreen forests, hot and dry thornveld, and in arid sandy plains. It grows most often as a spiny, scrambling bush or dense climber, hauling itself into the branches of trees and shrubs. It also grows on the tops of anthills, making a solid, tidy crown and occurs in the semi-arid and humid lowland and highland woodlands, forest edges and scrub. May become a weed if not adequately controlled.

Poison:  Roots of the species are very poisonous.
  Fruits are edible and are popular with African children.
Leaves, although browsed by cattle, kudus and rhino, are believed to be poisonous.
C. tomentosa is suitable for firewood.
Medicine:  The Zulus of South Africa use it to cure madness, snakebite, headache, impotence and sterility (in women). It is also used to treat fever; mixed with dried hyena and antelope blood and ox fat, it is used in the ritual treatment of pneumonia. A decoction of the leaves is used for the treatment of asthma; a decoction prepared by scraping the bark and mixing it with goat soup is drunk for chest pains. Decoction of the root is a cough remedy, but it must be used with care, as it is highly poisonous when taken in large quantities.
Trees are grown as a live fence"
Carapa guianensis,"Local names:
 English (bastard mahogany,crabwood,carapa), French (cabirma de Guinea,bois rouge,carapa,andiroba), Spanish (andiroba,caobilla,najesi,cedro macho,masábalo,cabrima de guiana), Trade name (bastard mahogany,crabwood,andiroba)
Carapa guianensis is a deciduous or semi-evergreen, monoecious, medium-sized to large trees up to 35 (max. 55) m tall; bole straight and cylindrical; branchless up to 20 (max. 30) m; up to 100 (max. 200) cm in diameter, sometimes fluted, with short buttresses up to 2 m high. Bark surface flaking into squarish scales or in horizontal strips, light grey to greyish brown or dark brown, sometimes reddish; inner bark fibrous, red or pinkish brown. Young plants produce taproots but the trees tend to become surface rooted.

Leaves alternate, paripinnate with a dormant glandular leaflet at the apex, exstipulate; leaflets opposite, entire. Shows gigantic leaves in the monocaulous juvenile stage, decreasing in size when branching is initiated.

Flowers small, white, borne in a large, axillary or subterminal thyrse; unisexual but with well-developed vestiges of the opposite sex; tetramerous to pentamerous (max. sextamerous); calyx lobed almost to the base; petals slightly contorted.

Fruit dehiscent, 4-lobed, pendulous, subglobose, woody capsule containing 2-4 seeds in each lobe. Seeds smooth, pale brown, angular, with woody sarcotesta.
Ecology

C. guianensis is a locally common element of the canopy or subcanopy layer of the South American evergreen to semi-evergreen rainforest. It sometimes occurs as a dominant tree or even in almost pure stands and is found predominantly along rivers and on periodically flooded or swampy locations but also on higher ground and low hills. In South America, foresters recognize 2 types of wood: ‘red’ or ‘hill crabwood’ and ‘white crabwood’. The former is said to be superior and is obtained from trees growing on higher land, whereas white crabwood is derived from trees in swampy locations.

Distributed from Central America (Belize) and the Caribbean south to Amazonian Brazil.
Native range
Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela
Tree management

In South America, C. guianensis showed a mean annual diameter increment of 1.6-2 m in 25-year-old plantations. A large tree may produce 750-4000 seeds/year, but seed production may be almost zero in unfavourable years.

C. guianensis may be considered for cultivation on swampy soils, since in a trial in Indonesia it proved resistant to oxygen deficiency, and mortality was not observed until after 90 days. In swamp forest, trees reach felling size in 20-25 years; at higher elevations probably in 40-60 years. Carapa is moderately tolerant of shade, but full overhead light is required for fast growth. It coppices freely and is resistant to fire.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant; 100% germination after 2 months, nothing after 3 months of open storage with 90% r.h., or 24-31 deg. C; no seeds survive following 7 months of storage in paper bags at 12 deg. C and 30% r.h., or 14 deg. C and 80% r.h., whereas viability is halved with fresh seeds sealed in polythene bags at these temperatures after 7 months; there is loss in viability on desiccation. There are 40-110 seeds/kg.

Distributed from Central America (Belize) and the Caribbean south to Amazonian Brazil.
Can be propagated by seed. When sown on the surface or shallowly in moist soil, all fresh seeds germinate. A lower rate may be due to seeds drying out, excessive watering or insect damage. Unscarified seeds complete germination in 19-21 days, while scarified seeds take 6-7 days. Large cuttings can be used when planted in swampy soil.

Early growth in the nursery is moderately fast, and seedlings may attain 0.5 m in the 1st year. The roots of 1-year-old seedlings are pruned at about 15 cm while plant is still in the nursery bed; when new rootlets begin to develop, the plant is uprooted and planted out.
Poison:  Seed oil has insecticidal properties.
Fibre:  The wood is suitable for the production of pulp and paper.
Timber: C. guianensis yields a medium-weight hardwood with a density of 580-750 kg/cubic m at 12% mc. Heartwood pale pink to red-brown when fresh, darkening to a medium reddish-brown to greyish sapwood; grain generally straight, sometimes interlocked; texture fine to coarse. Seasoning must be done carefully to avoid warping and checking. The timber is moderately soft to moderately hard, strong and moderately tough. Good working properties with a moderate dulling effect on tools and a slight tendency to split on nailing; glues well and polishes satisfactorily. Heartwood is moderately durable and resistant to termites.  Its main attraction is for high-quality furniture and cabinetwork, stairs and flooring, and as veneer for furniture, interior work and plywood. It is used for masts, building material and as a substitute for okoumé (Aucoumea klineana) and walnut (Juglans regia). In Colombia, shoemakers prefer it for making shoe pieces.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark is used for tanning.
Lipids:  Oil obtained from the seeds, called ‘crab oil’ or ‘andiroba’, is well known and used as lamp oil and for making soap and candles.
Medicine:  The bark contains an alkaloid, carapina, that is used as a febrifuge. Leaves boiled in water are applied to itchy skin; a fruit rind decoction is taken orally for fever and intestinal worms; a seed oil decoction is taken orally for hepatitis and tetanus and applied externally for skin diseases and ringworm.
Ornamental:  Planted as an ornamental in the Caribbean, where it is locally naturalized.
Soil improver: C. guianensis is suitable for enrichment planting."
Carica papaya,"Local names:
 Arabic (fafay,babaya), Bengali (pappaiya,papeya), Burmese (thimbaw), Creole (papayer,papaye), English (bisexual pawpaw,pawpaw tree,melon tree,papaya), Filipino (papaya,lapaya,kapaya), French (papailler,papaye,papayer), German (papaya,melonenbraum), Hindi
Carica papaya is an evergreen, tree-like herb, 2-10 m tall, usually unbranched, although sometimes branched due to injury, containing white latex in all parts. Stem cylindrical, 10-30 cm in diameter, hollow with prominent leaf scars and spongy-fibrous tissue. Has an extensive rooting system.

Leaves spirally arranged, clustered near apex of trunk; petiole up to 1 m long, hollow, greenish or purplish-green; lamina orbicular, 25-75 cm in diameter, palmate, deeply 7-lobed, glabrous, prominently veined; lobes deeply and broadly toothed. 

Flowers tiny, yellow, funnel-shaped, solitary or clustered in the leaf axils, of 3 types; female flowers 3-5 cm long, large functional pistil, no stamens, ovoid-shaped ovary; male flowers on long hanging panicles, with 10 stamens in 2 rows, gynoecium absent except for a pistillode; hermaphrodite flowers larger than males, 5-carpellate ovary; occurrence depends on the season or age of the tree.

Fruits large, cylindrical, with fleshy orange pulp, hollow berry, thin yellowish skin when ripe, varied. Fruits formed from female flowers are oblong, spherical, pear-shaped; from hermaphrodite flowers, long, obovoid or pyriform. Seeds numerous, small, black, round, covered with gelatinous aril. Small latex vessels extend throughout the tree and are particularly abundant in fruit that has reached full size but has not yet begun to ripen.

The generic name is from the Latin ‘carica’, meaning ‘edible fig’, on account of the similarity of the leaves.
Ecology

C. papaya grows satisfactorily in a wide range of areas from the equatorial tropics to temperate latitudes. However, it must be grown in warm, sunny sites sheltered from wind; preferably below 1500 m. Strong winds are detrimental, particularly on soils that cannot make up for large transpiration loss. C. papaya is not frost hardy; exposure to frost or cold wind usually results in leaf damage and subsequent death of the tree. Roots are very sensitive to waterlogging, and even short periods of flooding can kill the plant.
Native range
Costa Rica, Mexico, United States of America
Tree management

Weeds must be controlled, especially during the initial stages of establishment. Herbicides, hand weeding, mulching and use of cover crops are some of the practical methods used in the control of weeds. Even though fairly resistant to drought, C. papaya requires a constant water supply. C. papaya is very responsive to fertilizers, and yield can be significantly improved by proper fertilization. Control of pH is also very important. Fruit production begins within a year of planting and is continuous thereafter. C. papaya produces 30-150 fruits/year. As the fruit is formed in the leaf axils, plants must be kept growing continuously for maximum yield. Mature trees may be rejuvenated by cutting back to 30 cm above the ground. The latex should be tapped at least once a week.
Seeds have orthodox storage behaviour; viability can be maintained for up to 3 years in hermetic air-dry storage at 12 deg. C. There are 300-700 seeds in each fruit and approximately 20 000 seeds/kg.

C. papaya is not frost hardy; exposure to frost or cold wind usually results in leaf damage and subsequent death of the tree. Roots are very sensitive to waterlogging, and even short periods of flooding can kill the plant.
C. papaya is usually grown from seed, which germinates in 2-4 weeks under favourable conditions. Gelatinous covering is removed by rubbing the seed on cloth or a sheet of rubber. The seed is washed and dried on paper out of the sun. Often seedlings are raised in nurseries using flats with sterilized potting soil, placed in partial shade when seeds are sown. After 2 weeks, the seedlings are moved into full sunlight and a week later transferred to pots. Direct sowing in bottomless pots eliminates some transplanting problems. Seedlings are planted out in the field 6-8 weeks later at a density of 1000-2000 plants/ha with recommended spacing of 2.5-3 x 2-3 m, or 4.5 x 2 m where machinery is used. Direct sowing in the desired field is a simpler method; however seeds should be protected from pests such as ants. Since there is no reliable method of determining sex in papaya until 1st flowering occurs, at least 4-5 seedlings should be planted per planting hole.

Vegetative propagation is possible but rarely practised. Because the scarcity of scion material from mother plants makes it expensive, it is reserved only for experimental purposes. The top of the tree is broken off to induce development of shoots, which can then be used for cleft grafting or making cuttings.
  Ripe papaya is a favourite breakfast and dessert fruit that is available year-round. It can be used to make fruits salads, refreshing drinks, jam, jelly, marmalade, candies and crystallized fruit. Green fruit is pickled or cooked as vegetable or as a substitute for applesauce. About 60% of the ripe fruit is edible. The approximate content per 100 g edible portion is water 86.6 g, protein 0.5 g, fat 0.3 g, carbohydrates 12.1 g, fibre 0.7 g, ash 0.5 g, potassium 204 mg, calcium 34 mg, phosphorus 11 mg, iron 1 mg, sodium 3 mg, vitamin A 450 mg, vitamin C 74 mg, thiamine 0.03 mg, niacin 0.5 mg, and riboflavin 0.04 mg. The energy value is 200 kJ/100 g. Major sugars are sucrose (48.3%), glucose (29.8%) and fructose (21.9%). In Java, a sweetmeat is made from the flowers. Young leaves are sometimes eaten.
Medicine:  Carapine, an alkaloid present in papaya, can be used as a heart depressant, amoebicide and diuretic. The fruit and juice are eaten for gastrointestinal ailments; a fresh leaf poultice is used to treat sores. The fresh root with sugarcane alcohol can be taken orally or as a massage to soothe rheumatism. A flower decoction is taken orally for coughs, bronchitis, asthma and chest colds. In some countries, the seeds are used as an abortifacient and vermifuge.
Latex or rubber:  In some countries, C. papaya is grown in sizeable plantations for the extraction of papain, a proteolytic enzyme present in the latex, collected mainly from green fruit. Papain has varied uses in beverage, food and pharmaceutical industr"
Carissa congesta,"Local names:
 English (Christ's thorn,Bengal currant), Filipino (perunkila,caraunda,caranda,caramba), Hindi (karaunda,karanda), Malay (kerenda,karaunda), Thai (namdaeng,nam phrom)
Carissa congesta is a rank-growing, straggly, woody, climbing shrub, usually growing to 3-5 m high, sometimes ascending to the tops of tall trees. Branches numerous and spreading, forming dense masses, set with sharp, simple or forked thorns, up to 5 cm long, in pairs in the axils of the leaves.

Leaves evergreen, opposite, oval or elliptic, 2.5-7.5 cm long; dark-green, leathery, glossy on the upper surface, lighter green and dull on the underside.

Flowers fragrant, tubular with 5 hairy lobes, twisted to the left in the bud instead of to the right as in other species; white, often tinged with pink, borne in terminal clusters of 2 to 12.

Fruits in clusters of 3-10, oblong, broad-ovoid or round, 1.25-2.5 cm long; skin fairly thin but tough, purplish-red, turning dark-purple or nearly black when ripe; smooth, glossy; enclosing very acid to fairly sweet, often bitter, red or pink juicy pulp, exuding flecks of latex. There may be 2 to 8 small, flat, brown seeds.

The name Carissa is probably derived from the Sanskrit ‘corissa’, a name for one of the Indian species of the genus.
Ecology

C.  congesta is more cold-tolerant than the carissa (Carissa macrocarpa). It grows from sea-level to 600 m in the Philippines; but up to an altitude of 1 800 m in the Himalayas; its chief requirement is full exposure to sun.
Native range
India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka
Tree management

The plant grows slowly when young. Once well established, it grows more vigorously and becomes difficult to control. If kept trimmed to encourage new shoots, karanda blooms and fruits profusely.

Propagation is usually by seed. Experimental work in India has shown that cuttings from mature plants may not root at all; 20% of hardwood cuttings from trimmed hedges have rooted in November but not when planted earlier. Cuttings from nursery stock gave best results: 10% rooted in late September; 20% in early October; 30% in late October; and 50% in early November. In all cases, cuttings were pre-treated with indolebutyric acid at 500 ppm in 50% alcohol. Tender tip cuttings could be rooted under constant mist, the karanda can be grafted onto self-seedlings.
Poison:  A paste of the pounded roots serves as a fly repellant.
  The unripe fruit is sour and astringent and is used for pickles. When ripe it is sweet and is used for tarts, puddings and jellies. The syrup has been successfully utilized on a small scale in soft drinks.
C. congesta leaves are fodder for the tussar silkworm.
It is used as fuelwood.
Timber:  The white or yellow wood is hard, smooth and useful for fashioning spoons, combs, household utensils and miscellaneous products of turnery. 
Tannin or dyestuff: The fruits have been employed as agents in tanning and dyeing.
Medicine: The unripe fruit is used medicinally as an astringent. The ripe fruit is taken as an antiscorbutic and remedy for biliousness. The leaf decoction is valued in cases of intermittent fever, diarrhoea, oral inflammation and earache. The root is employed as a bitter stomachic, vermifuge and an ingredient in a remedy for itches. 
Ornamental:  C.  congesta is conspicuous when in starry bloom.
The plant has dense branches and sharp spreading thorns, and is suitable for fences."
Dacryodes edulis,"Local names:
 English (native pear,bush butter tree,African plum,African pear,African palm), French (safoutier,prunier,atanga)
Dacryodes edulis is a medium-sized, evergreen tree attaining a height of 18-40 m in the forest but not exceeding 12 m in plantations. It is generally branched from low down, with a deep, dense crown. The bole is rather short, slightly fluted, 50-170 cm in diameter and more or less sinuous. The scented, pale grey, rough bark exudes a whitish resin. Buttresses are absent.

Leaves compound, imparipinnate, with 5-8 pairs of leaflets; glossy above, pubescent, the pubescence disappearing with age.

Flowers subtended, 3 lobed, conspicuous, caducous brow bracts, fragrant, about 5 mm across, trimerous except for the ovary, arranged in dense, ferruginous, stellate-tomentose inflorescence; sepals 3, brown; petals 3, cream-yellow; stamens 6, white; disc 6 lobed, surrounding the 2-celled, glabrous ovary; inflorescence axis 10-42 cm long or longer, deeply grooved.

Fruits ellipsoidal drupes rather variable in size, 4-12 x 3-6 cm, resembling olives; exocarp thin, pink, becoming dark blue to violet at maturity; pulp firm and thin.

On the basis of long-term and extensive field observations in Nigeria, 2 varieties of D. edulis were distinguished: D. e. var. edulis and D. e. var. parvicarpa. Fruit of D. e. var. edulis is large, elongated, cylindrical, usually more than 5 x 2.5 cm. The fruit pulp is thick, about 3.5-9 mm. The tree often has whorled branching, the branchlets stout and ascending. The fruit of D. e. var. parvicarpa is small, rounded or more or less conical, usually less than 5 x 2.5 cm. The fruit pulp is thin, about 2-3.5 mm. Often the tree has bifurcate branching, with slender, drooping branchlets. 

The generic name is derived from the Greek word 'dakruon' (a tear) in reference to the resin droplets on bark surface of its members. The specific name ‘edulis’ means edible.
Ecology

D. edulis is a shade-loving species of non-flooded forests in the humid tropical zone. Where there is a well-marked season, it is found only in gallery forest and on swampy ground. D. edulis can be cultivated widely, since it adapts well to differences in day length, temperature, rainfall, soils and altitude. It is planted in southern Nigeria, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo for its nutritious fruit, which has a high oil content.
Native range
Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Togo, Uganda
Tree management

The recommended spacing for planting D. edulis in orchards is 10 x 10 m. Care for the trees is minimal, often limited to slashing the weeds around each tree. Except when planting, fertilizing or manuring is not used; pruning and crop protection are not practised.
Germplasm collections have not been initiated for D. edulis, nor have any strategies been drawn up for genebanks or in situ reserves for the species. The seeds are recalcitrant, so ex situ collections will entail establishing orchard seed banks.

Storage behaviour is uncertain; whole seed moisture content is 42%; 25% germination following 14 days open storage at 15 deg. C, while no seeds germinate when stored at 25 deg. C or 5 deg. C.

It is planted in southern Nigeria, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo for its nutritious fruit, which has a high oil content.
No artificial selection has been attempted with D. edulis; thus there is a continuum of fruit sizes rather than clear-cut botanical races. It is usually propagated from seed sown either in the open ground or in long polythene bags. Germination is epigeal.

Vegetative propagation is difficult although some farmers keep or transplant wild trees, but air layering has proved successful (up to 80% take) and is now practised in a few areas, using selected mother trees. It takes 4-6 months before the layers can be separated and this should not be done when the mother tree is about to flush. Plantlets have been obtained by tissue culturing of cotyledons. In laying out an orchard, 5% of the trees should be male-flowering to ensure adequate cross-pollination.
  The principle value of the tree lies in its fruit. The leathery, shelled stone is surrounded by a pulpy, butryaceous pericarp about 5 mm thick, which is the portion eaten either raw or cooked in form of a sort of butter. It has a mild smell of turpentine and is oily. The fruits are boiled in saltwater, fried or roasted over charcoal. The fruit pulp yields about 48% edible oil, is rich in vitamins and contains a range of amino acids.
The kernel, which contains about 3.3% protein, is commonly fed to domestic livestock such as sheep and goats.
Apiculture: The native pear has attractive flowers because of the existence of nectar. During anthesis phases, the ovary produces a sweet substance which attracts bees and other insects. The species can be thus used as a melliferous tree.
Timber:  The wood is elastic, greyish-white to pinkish. The sapwood and heartwood are difficult to distinguish. The wood has general use for tool handles, particularly axe shafts, and occasionally for mortars, and is suitable for carpentry.
Shade or shelter:  In Nigeria the tree is planted for shade.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The leaves of D. edulis contain a dye.
Lipids:  The wood contains an oil that on petrol-ether extraction has been found to be composed of fatty acids and their esters. The fresh pulp is rich in lipids (35-65%) with a considerable amount of palmitic and linoleic acid. The tree can produce 7-8 t/ha of oil.
Medicine:  A perennial cure for a variety of ailments, ranging from ear infection to fevers and oral problems. In Nigeria the resin is used for treating parasitic skin diseases and jiggers. Pulped bark is used to cicatrize wounds. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a bark decoction is used for gargle and mouthwash and for tonsillitis. It is taken in a powdered form with maleguetta pepper as an anti-dysenteric and for anaemia and for spitting blood and as an emmenagogue. With palm oil, it is applied topically to relieve general pains and stiffness and to treat cutaneous conditions. A decoction of the root bark is taken for leprosy. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the leaves are eaten raw with kola nut as an anti-emetic. Leaf sap is instilled into the ear for ear problems, and a leaf decoction is prepared as a vapour bath for feverish stiffness with headache.
Gum or resin:  The bark is aromatic; on injury, it yields a resin that is used as pitch on calabashes and for mending earthenware. It can be burnt as a primitive lamp oil or bush candle.
Ornamental:  Because of its rythmical growth process and the colour of young leaves, the plum tree can be used as an ornamental during the first ages. It is therefore often found as a garden tree in and around villages.
Soil improver: Leaves and the remains of the fruits can provide considerable quantities of biomass to improve soil fertility. Research carried out in the forest humid lowland of south Cameroon, showed that the peasant farmers use the tree as a good indicator of soils fertility.
Intercropping: The plant canopy can allow its integration into the traditional farming systems involving food crops, mainly shade tolerant species such as Xanthosoma saggittifolium, Colocosia esculenta etc. The double revolution of the African plum tree in the forest zone of Cameroon which doesn’t necessarily go together with the flowering of the food crops, leads to a progressive harvesting during the year. The tree is usually grown to provide shade, mainly for perennial crops such as cocoa and coffee, in Nigeria.
Essential oil: Under steam distillation, the resin has been reported to yield a peppery essential oil rich in sabinene, beta-phellandrene and limonene."
Dactyladenia barteri,"Local names:
 English (monkey fruit)
Dactyladenia barteri is a climbing shrub or small tree, up to 12 m tall; bole fluted, often multiple, crooked, up to 25(-40) cm in diameter; bark brittle, slash thin and watery white, turning reddish; crown dense, spreading. Young shoots dark red, covered with whitish arachnoid tomentum, early caducous; branches more or less scandent, slender, hispid, and very quickly glabrescent when young, with numerous lenticels when old.

Leaves alternate, simple; stipules often attached near the base of the petiole, linear, 4-6 mm long; petiole 3-4 mm long; blade elliptical-oblong to ovate, 7-13(-15) cm x 3-5.5(-7) cm, dark glossy green, turning reddish-brown when senescent, base acuminate, sometimes broadly acuminate and somewhat asymmetrical, apex acuminate; lateral veins in 4-6 pairs, some circular glands often present on the underside of the blade near the base and apex.

Inflorescence a terminal or axillary raceme, single or sometimes in pairs, 3-4(-12) cm long, puberulous, many flowered; peduncle up to 1(-4) cm long; bracts elliptical-lanceolate, 2-4 mm long, tricuspidate, often with circular glands; pedicel articulated; flowers bisexual, zygomorphic; receptacal tubular, 4-6 mm long, puberulous; sepals 5, 4-5 mm long, puberulous outside; petals 5, oblong-obovoid, white, caducous; stamens 15-20, 25 mm long; pistil with 1-locular ovary, a filiform style slightly longer than the stamens, and a 3-lobed stigma.

Fruit a single-seeded drupe, compressed-ovoid, 2.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 5 cm, green, surface often ferruginous-tomentose, apex often slightly tuberculate.
Ecology

D. barteri occurs in lowland forest with at least 1 200 mm rainfall per year. In the forest-savanna transition zone, it is found along riverbanks, sometimes on the inland side of mangrove forest. It is well adapted to leached, acid and infertile soils and can survive occasional flooding and fires.
Native range
Cameroon, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone
Tree management

In traditional cropping systems, D. barteri is retained, planted scattered, or in hedgerows. Established trees coppice well, even after pollarding or burning and are fire resistant. It is planted at a spacing of 2-3 m between the hedgerows in fallow systems in Nigeria. Planted at 4 m x 4m, it can produce 6t/ha dry prunings, 4 ton twigs and 9 ton wood within 8 months with a nutrient yield of 85 kg N, 5 kg P, 43 kg K, 18 kg Ca and 46 kg Mg. At the beginning of the cropping cycle, the shrubs are burnt and the stems cut at a height of 10-20 cm above ground.
Seed germinates readily and can be stored for up to 6 months at 15 deg C when treated with copper sulphate.
D. barteri occurs in lowland forest with at least 1 200 mm rainfall per year. In the forest-savanna transition zone, it is found along riverbanks, sometimes on the inland side of mangrove forest. It is well adapted to leached, acid and infertile soils and can survive occasional flooding and fires.
Propagation is mainly by seed. Occasionally, stakes are used as cuttings in live fence systems. Direct sowing is possible but seedlings survive better when raised in nursery bags before planting out.
Erosion control:  The shrubs have an extensive root system that holds the soil.
Leaves are used as fodder.
Timber:  Wood is dark red, hard, durable and resistant to termite attack. Stems are used for construction work.
Medicine: In Nigeria and Liberia, the bark and roots are used medicinally as a purgative and against a variety of ailments.
Stems provide good quality poles for staking yams and for construction.
Soil improver:  Monkey fruit produces large amounts of litter and recycles appreciable quantities of nutrients through its deep root system and the dense canopy aids in weed suppression. It has shown promise as mulch because of its slow decomposition rate.
Intercropping:  The tree has shown promise in alley cropping systems on acid soils in Nigeria."
Dalbergia latifolia,"Local names:
 Bengali (swetasal,sitsal), English (black rosewood,blackwood,Bombay black wood,East Indian rosewood,Indian palisandre,Java palisandre,Roseta rosewood), French (palisandre de l'Inde,Palissandre Asie,Palissandre d'Asie), German (Indischer Rosenholzbaum,Ind
Dalbergia latifolia is predominantly a single-stemmed deciduous tree with a dome shaped crown of lush green foliage, which on wet sites are not shed. The trees reach a height of 20-40 m with a girth of 1.5-2m. The bark is gray, thin with irregular short cracks, exfoliating in fibrous longitudinal flakes.

Leaves are alternate, odd-pinnate with 5-7 unequal sized leaflets originating from the same rachis. Leaflets are broadly obtuse, dark green above and pale below.

Flowers are white in axillary panicles, 0.5-1 cm long.

The brown pods are oblong-lanceolate and pointed at both ends. They contain 1-4 smooth brown seeds and do not open at maturity.

The name is in honour of the Swedish brothers Nils and Carl Dalberg, who lived in the 18th century. The former was a botanist and the latter explored Surinam. The specific name is Latin and means broad-leaved.
Ecology

Indian rosewood is reported to be scattered in the dry deciduous forests throughout the Indian peninsula. It grows in the sub-Himalayan tract from Oudh eastwards to Sikkim, Bihar, Orissa, and throughout central and southern India. Optimum growing conditions for the species are reported to be in the Bombay region.
Native range
India, Indonesia
Tree management

As pure stands, D. latifolia is spaced at 1.2 - 2.5 by 1 - 1.8. Wider spacing may produce crooked stems. For agroforestry systems spacing of 3 by 1 - 6 by 2 m are common. Trees are usually harvested in 30-40 years. D. latifolia is generally managed by clear felling followed by artifial regeneration. After planting or direct sowing, regular weeding is necessary until trees can withstand weed competition. Loosening soil around seedlings also improves growth. Weeding and soil loosening should be done before weeds become dense.
Seeds remain viable for a period of about 6 months and lose their viability appreciably when kept for more than one year. Seed viability can be extended to 9-12 months by drying seeds to 8 % moisture content and storing them in airtight containers, however, germination will decrease to 30-40%. 

Studies in India reveal considerable variation in seed weight (18,500 to 40,000 seeds per kilogram). Germination takes 7 to 25 days and the germination varies from 45 to 80% for fresh seeds.

It grows in the sub-Himalayan tract from Oudh eastwards to Sikkim, Bihar, Orissa, and throughout central and southern India. Optimum growing conditions for the species are reported to be in the Bombay region.
Under natural conditions, D. latifolia reproduces by seed, root sucker or coppice. Artificial reproduction is common by seed, root cutting, and stump sprout. Direct seeding is possible under moist conditions with good weed control. Root cuttings can be planted directly in the field or raised in a nursery for future transplanting. Nursery grown seedlings are transplanted to the field after six months in Java, and 12 months in India. Although no treatment is necessary, soaking seed in cool water for 12-24 hours will hasten germination.
Apiculture: Like other member of the genus Dalbergia, its honey is dark amber and strong flavoured.
Timber: The sharply defined sapwood is yellowish or pale yellowish-white, often with a purplish tinge. Heartwood varies in color from rose to dark-brown with darker purple-black lines or deep purple with black lines. The darker streaks impart an attractive figure to the timber. The heartwood darkens with age and weighs about 850 kg/cu. m. The wood is fragrant, very hard and difficult to work because of its high density.  Rosewood has exceptional dimensional stability, and retains its shape very well after seasoning. The heartwood is rated as very durable, and is generally highly resistant to attack by termites and decay fungi. Heartwood resistance to termites is reported to be only moderate in India. The sapwood, however, is liable to powder-post beetle attack. It is used to make premium-grade furniture, paneling, veneers, and interior and exterior joinery. Secondary uses of the wood include knife handles, musical instruments, agricultural implements calico-printing blocks, mathematical instruments, and boat keels and screws. Fine furniture, decorative veneer, specialty items, joinery, bedroom suites, figured veneer, living-room suites, office furniture, tables. 
Shade or shelter: The species is planted as a shade tree in coffee plantations and on roadsides.
Medicine:  Medicines are made from the tannins in the bark, for diarrhoea, worms, indigestion, and leprosy. These tannins also produce an appetizer.
Nitrogen fixing:  D. latifolia is known to be a nitrogen fixing tree.
Soil improver: D. latifolia leaf litter decomposes slowly releasing nutrients gradually and it is used as a mulch.
Intercropping:  The tree is usually intercropped with annual crops under taungya or with fruit trees"
Dalbergia melanoxylon,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (driedoring ebbehout,swartdriedoring,sebrahout), Amharic (zobbi), Arabic (kelto,babanous,babanus), English (African blackwood,Mozambique ebony,Javanese palisander,ebony,blackwood,Senegal ebony,African ironwood,African ebony,zebra wood,blackwood
Dalbergia melanoxylon is a small, heavily branched tree, typically 4.5-7.5 m tall but occasionally reaching 15 m. The bole is fluted with high narrow ribs separated by deep indentations. Bole length occasionally reaches 3.6 m but normally ranges within .2-1.8 m. Average dbh at maturity is less than 38 cm, although trees have been found with a dbh of more than 60 cm. Bark pale grey to greyish-brown, papery, fairly smooth, and flaking in long, narrow strips. Stems often crooked. Branchlets clustered at the nodes, some growing out, others short and spine tipped; covered at first with short crisp hairs, usually glabrous.

Leaves have a slender, common stalk 5-10 cm long; 8-13 leaflets sometimes nearly opposite, increasing in size upwards but all much the same shape; terminal leaflet 12-36 mm long by 12-18 mm broad, obovate, broadly notched at the apex, or almost flat, with midrib projecting, more or less rounded at the base; leaflet stalks slender, about 2 mm long.

Flowers white, fragrant 6-9 cm long, occurring in dense clusters. Stamens usually 9, united or variously divided.

Pods elliptic oblong or irregularly oblong, bluntly pointed, flat and thin, 3-7 cm long and 0.5-1.5 cm wide. They tend to be papery, glabrous, laxly and rather diffusely veined, with 1-2 seeds.

The generic name Dalbergia honours the Swedish brothers Nils and Carl Dalberg, who lived in the 18th century. The former was a botanist and the latter explored Surinam. The specific name is Greek and means dark wood.
Ecology

D. melanoxylon grows under a wide range of conditions including semi-arid, subhumid and tropical lowland areas. It is often found on dry, rocky sites but is most frequent in the mixed deciduous forests and savannahs of the coastal region. This species demands water and light and therefore is common near water and will not regenerate under heavy cover. Mature trees are fire tolerant.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Field trials are currently exploring suitable spacing for D. melanoxylon plantations. An initial spacing of 2 x 2 m results in good branching characteristics, while later thinning improves growth. Stem form is improved by raising the trees under medium shade provided by Pinus caribaea. Thorough weeding is important at the initial phase of establishment. After 5-7 years, trees planted early in the rainy season on thoroughly weeded plots averaged about 30% taller than trees planted at the same time but only lightly weeded. Trees planted in the middle of the rainy season and thoroughly weeded were about 45% taller than those planted at the beginning of the rains and lightly weeded. Intensive weeding is crucial until the tree’s root-collar diameter measures about 5 cm. Alternatively, the area around the tree should be slashed until its root-collar diameter measures 8-10 cm. The species is extremely slow growing; trees attain timber size in 70-100 years.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 9-12% mc. There are about 42 000 seeds/kg.

This species demands water and light and therefore is common near water and will not regenerate under heavy cover. Mature trees are fire tolerant.
D. melanoxylon has not been cultivated extensively. Seed extracted from pods germinate readily without pretreatment. Experimental work in Tanzania suggests that survival and growth are improved by planting 2-year-old stumps that are 14 cm long, comprising 12 cm of root and 2 cm of shoot. These should be planted in the early or middle part of the rainy season, followed by intensive weeding. Potted seedlings may also be used, but they tend to grow more slowly. When seedlings are raised in pots, frequent root pruning is mandatory. Delayed pruning leads to seedling shock. Advanced plant-production techniques such as tissue culture or use of growth hormones have not been tested.
The pods and leaves can be used as animal fodder.
Apiculture: Like other members of the genus Dalbergia, its honey is dark amber and strong flavoured.
The calorific value of the wood is more than 49 000 kcal/kg. Heat generation is so high that fires of D. melanoxylon have been reported to melt cooking utensils.
Timber:  The sapwood is white or yellowish-white, often 12 cm wide, and sharply differentiated. The heartwood is purplish black, sometimes darker towards the outside, with light streaks and not always uniform in colour. The timber is slightly oily, exceptionally hard and very heavy (1314 kg/cu. m), brittle and somewhat fissile. The heartwood is extremely durable and resistant to all forms of biological deterioration. The sapwood, however, is susceptible to fungal or insect attack. The dry wood is difficult to saw or plane. It blunts saws and cutters and cannot be nailed or screwed without drilling. It is, however, among the finest of all turnery timbers, cutting exactly and finishing to a brilliantly polished, lustrous surface, dry and cold to the touch. Other products made from the timber include carvings, turnery and marquetry to produce sculptures, musical instruments, ornaments, inlays, chess pieces, walking sticks, bearings and many other products. The main industrial use, long supporting an export trade from East Africa and Mozambique, is the manufacture of musical instruments, especially woodwinds. With its high density and fine texture, D. melanoxylon wood produces a beautiful musical tone. It is stable, stands up to metalwork processes, and takes an excellent finish.
Medicine:  The roots are used in traditional medicines to treat abdominal pain, diarrhoea and syphilis; the wood smoke is inhaled to treat headaches and bronchitis."
Dalbergia sissoo,"Local names:
 Arabic (dalbergia,sissoo), Bengali (shisu,shishu,sisu), English (Bombay blackwood,sissoo,Indian rosewood,sisso), Hindi (agaru,biridi,tali,gette,kara,shisham,sisam,sissai,sissu,sissoo), Indonesian (pradu-khaek,du-khaek), Javanese (sonowaseso), Nepali (sis
Dalbergia sissoo is a medium to large-sized deciduous tree, growing up to 30 m in height and 80 cm dbh under favourable conditions. Crown wide spreading and thin. Bark thin, grey, longitudinally furrowed, exfoliating in narrow strips. Develops a long taproot from an early age, and numerous lateral ramifying roots.

The leaves are imparipinate; leaflets 3-5, alternate, 2.5-3.6 cm in diameter, broad ovate, acuminate, glabrescent, petiolules 3-5 mm long. 

Flowers 5-8 mm long, pale white to dull yellow, racemes 2.5-3.7 cm long in short axillary panicles. 

Pods 5-7.5 cm x 8-13 mm, narrowed at the base, indehiscent, glabrous, with 1-4 seeds. Seeds 6-8 x 4-5 mm, kidney shaped, thin and flat, light brown.

The generic name Dalbergia honours the Swedish brothers Nils and Carl Dalberg, who lived in the 18th century. The former was a botanist and the latter explored Surinam.
Ecology

Abundant moisture and lack of competition are the key to its successful regeneration; it is therefore found in riverine environments where sunlight and moisture are plentiful. Associated with Pinus roxburghii, Acacia catechu and Shorea robusta. D. sissoo is adapted to a seasonal monsoon climate and a dry season of up to 6 months.
Native range
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Malaysia, Pakistan
Tree management

A fast-growing species; growth rates of 3.7 m in 1 year, 5 m in 3 years, 11 m in 5 years and 15 m in 10 years have been recorded. D. sissoo plantations are established in block or strip plantations at 1.8 x 1.8 m to 4 x 4 m. Closer spacing is used for straight timber of good quality. When the canopy closes, at about 6 years, 30-40% of the stems are thinned to selectively remove suppressed, diseased and badly formed trees. Thinning is recommended every 10 years where the rotation is 30-60 years. There is evidence that the stumps begin to lose vigour after 2 or 3 rotations when managed as a coppice crop. It coppices vigorously up to about 20 years of age.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability is maintained for 4 years in hermetic storage and 1-2 years when stored in airtight containers under dry, cool (5-22 deg. C) conditions. There are approximately 45 000-55 000 seeds/kg.
Abundant moisture and lack of competition are the key to its successful regeneration; it is therefore found in riverine environments where sunlight and moisture are plentiful. Associated with Pinus roxburghii, Acacia catechu and Shorea robusta. D. sissoo is adapted to a seasonal monsoon climate and a dry season of up to 6 months.
While seeds may be sown without pretreatment, it is recommended that they be soaked in water at room temperature for 24-48 hr, inoculated with Rhizobium after soaking and sown immediately. D. sissoo rarely regenerates under the parent canopy. Natural regeneration is nonetheless abundant along streams and riverbanks where the pods have been carried by floods. Ripe pods may be collected manually by climbing trees and picking the fruits or by shaking the branches and picking the fruits from the ground. Propagation by root suckers is done best by cutting stems just below the soil surface. While it is difficult to propagate using stem and branch cuttings without hormone treatments, exogenous application of auxins (IAA, IBA and NAA) have been found to improve survival and growth rates.
Poison: Dalbergia sissoo is reported to have pesticidal properties. Aqueous extracts from the leaves, stems and roots inhibit the reproduction, growth and development of the insect pest Utethesia pulchella. Mixed with Azadirachta indica oil cake, sawdust from D. sissoo reduces egg laying and increases larval mortality in Melodogyne javanica. Methanol extract from the roots has insecticidal properties, especially against Diacrisia obliqua, Spodoptera litura and Argina cubrania.
Due to its vigorous reproduction through suckers, it is useful for stabilizing eroding sites. It is therefore found in a variety of wastelands, like in south Asia, where it is known as a colonizing species.
Young branches and foliage form an excellent fodder with a dry-matter content of 32.46%, crude protein 2.7-24.1%. The foliage has normally been used as emergency feed when other fodder sources fail.
Apiculture:  A useful source of honey but the flowers are only lightly attached to the flower branch and fall easily. The bees are therefore not able to take full advantage of the large number of flowers. The honey produced is dark amber with a strong fla
The species is fast growing, hence suitable for firewood. Sapwood and heartwood have calorific values of 4.9 and 5.2 kcal/g respectively.
Fibre:  Sulphate pulp from wood is used in producing writing and printing paper.
Timber: Dalbergia sissoo is one of the most useful timber species of India. The heartwood is very hard and close grained with a specific gravity of 0.62-0.82. It seasons well and does not warp or split; it is extremely durable and is one of the timbers least susceptible to dry-wood termites in India. Wood offers resistance to sawing and cutting but is excellent for turnery, takes a good polish and finishes to a smooth surface. It is used for high-quality furniture, cabinets, decorative veneer, marine and aircraft grade plywood, ornamental turnery, carving, engraving, tool handles and sporting goods. Its root wood is used for tobacco pipes. In village industry, D. sissoo is popular for doors and windows.
Shade or shelter:  Used as a windbreak in mango, coffee and tea plantations. These shade-loving crops also benefit from improved soil fertility under D. sissoo.
Tannin or dyestuff: Dalbergia sissoo pods contain 2% tannin.
Lipids:  Heartwood yields light brown, viscous, non-drying fixed oil (5.35%), suitable as a lubricant for heavy machinery.
Medicine:  Oil obtained from the seeds is used to cure skin diseases. The powdered wood, applied externally as a paste, is reportedly used to treat leprosy and skin diseases. The roots contain tectoridin, which is used medicinally.
Nitrogen fixing:  The tree nodulates; the nodules are moderate, globose to elongate. It therefore improves soil fertility.
Ornamental:  Widely used in urban and roadside plantings in the Indian subcontinent and in other parts of the world. It is noted as one of the most desirable trees for streets and backyards in Florida and Arizona, USA. It has been used for landscaping along the shores of the Sea of Galilee, Israel. 
Soil improver:  Heavy litter fall decomposes to enrich the soil with nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon.
Intercropping:  It may be planted as one component of a multitiered homegarden system, where it contributes several products.
Other services: Dalbergia sissoo has an unusual amenity use as a host for orchids. The sub-Himalayas, the homeland of D. sissoo, abound with a variety of orchids, many of which are known throughout the world for their beauty."

Ornamental:  D. elata is a distinct, magnificent tree in bloom, suitable for cultivation in gardens, avenues and amenity parks.
Poles from D. elata are used for fencing.
Soil improver:  D. elata leaves as a green manure are rich in Magnesium, yielding 50-200 kg of mulch per year. In Madras, India the leaves are used as mulch in rice fields.
Intercropping:  D. elata is a multipurpose tree commonly found planted or cultivated."
Delonix regia,"Local names:
 Amharic (dire dawa zaf), Arabic (goldmore), Bengali (chura,radha), Burmese (seinban), Creole (poinciana royal), English (flamboyant,gold mohur,flame of the forest,julu tree,peacock flower,flame tree,flamboyant flame tree,gul mohr,royal poinciana), French
Delonix regia is a tree 10-15 (max. 18) m high, attaining a girth of up to 2 m; trunk large, buttressed and angled towards the base; bark smooth, greyish-brown, sometimes slightly cracked and with many dots (lenticels); inner bark light brown; crown umbrella shaped, spreading with the long, nearly horizontal branches forming a diameter that is wider than the tree’s height; twigs stout, greenish, finely hairy when young, becoming brown. Roots shallow.

Leaves biparipinnate, alternate, light green, feathery, 20-60 cm long; 10-25 pairs of pinnae, 5-12 cm long, each bearing 12-40 pairs of small oblong-obtuse leaflets that are about 0.5-2 cm long and 0.3 cm wide; petiole stout. The numerous leaflets are stalkless, rounded at the base and apex, entire thin, very minutely hairy on both sides, green on the upper surface. At the base of the leaf stalk, there are 2 compressed stipules that have long, narrow, comblike teeth.

Corymbs 15-30 cm long, borne laterally near the end of the twig, each with loosely arranged, slightly fragrant flowers; flowers 5-13 cm across, with 5 equal petals, on slender stalks 5-7.6 cm long. Petals 5-6.5 cm long, 2-3 cm wide, orbicular, broadly spoon shaped, rounded but broader than long, slightly wavy-margined or crisp, tapering into claws about 2.5 cm long, widely extended and bending backwards before falling. Petals 4, orange-red, almost scarlet, 1 longer and narrower than the others, whitish inside with red spots and streaks; stalk very long, slender and hairy. Sepals 5, thick, green outside and reddish with yellow border within, reflexed when the flowers open, pointed, finely hairy, about 2.5 cm long. Stamens 5 with 10 red filaments; pistil has a hairy 1-celled ovary about 1.3 cm long and slender style about 3 cm long.

Fruit green and flaccid when young, turning to dark brown, hard, woody pods, 30-75 cm long, 3.8 cm thick, 5-7.6 cm broad, ending in a short beak when mature, with many horizontally partitioned seed chambers inside, indehiscent, finally splitting into 2 parts. The conspicuous pods hang down and remain attached most of the year even when the trees are leafless. Seeds 30-45, hard, greyish, glossy, to 2 cm long, oblong and shaped very much like date seeds, transversely mottled with a bony testa. They are arranged at right angles to the length of the pod.

The generic name, ‘Delonix’, is derived from a Greek delos (visible), and onyx (claw), in allusion to the conspicuously clawed petals. The specific name, ‘regia’, is from the Latin word ‘regis’ (royal, regal, magnificent). Most of its common names are derived from its large, flame-red flowers.
Ecology

D. regia originates from Madagascar, where it is now almost extinct. It is now widespread in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Trees can grow at higher altitudes than recommended, but flowering becomes erratic. The tree demands light and grows weakly and sparsely under shade. It grows in areas with both high and scanty rainfall. D. regia has a superficial root system and competes successfully with the neighbouring shrubs and flowering plants, rendering bare the ground under its canopy. It should therefore be planted away from other plants in the gardens. Trees are deciduous only where the dry season is long and pronounced.
Native range
Madagascar, Zambia
Tree management

D. regia can be planted in areas where rainfall is less than the recommended amount, as long as irrigation is practised. It is fast growing, and pollarding is a suitable practice. Careful pruning will achieve good crown form. The trees have shallow root systems and the wood is weak; they are therefore liable to being uprooted during strong storms and broken by strong winds. After the leaves are shed, the trees are less attractive, with their conspicuous pods remaining on the bare branches and with prominent tunnels and nests of termites that commonly attacks this species. Another objectionable feature is the surface root system, which sometimes breaks sidewalks and walls. Because of these undesirable characteristics, some authorities classify flamboyant as a tree that should not be planted.
Seeds can be stored for a long time if insect attack is avoided, which can be done by adding ash to the seeds. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox and a germination rate of 47% has been recorded after 9 years of storage at room temperature; no loss in viability following 4 years of storage. Viability is maintained following 3 years of hermetic storage at room temperature with 13-12% mc, and for at least 5 years in hermetic storage at room temperature. Average moisture of seeds is 10.45%, and there are about 2000-3245 seeds/kg.

D. regia has a superficial root system and competes successfully with the neighbouring shrubs and flowering plants, rendering bare the ground under its canopy. It should therefore be planted away from other plants in the gardens. Trees are deciduous only where the dry season is long and pronounced.
D. regia is easily propagated from seeds that have a hard, woody testa and take a long time to germinate. They may lie for 2-3 years in the soil without germinating and usually take 12-349 days to germinate. To break this dormancy, pretreatment is practised; a small portion of the seed coat is clipped, or seeds are boiled in hot water, then allowed to soak for 24 hours. After seeds are sown in unshaded nursery beds, they germinate within 5-10 days, with a germination rate of up to 90%; subsequent growth in the nursery is quite fast. Alternatively, the seeds can be directly sown in polythene bags, 4-5 seeds/bag. Seedlings watered and weeded regularly are planted out in the rainy season, with total time required in the nursery being 3-5 months. Keeping the plants for more than 9 months is not desirable, as they become too tall to handle, but seedlings can be transplanted even when 20-25 cm high. Trees can also be propagated from branch cuttings. Natural regeneration is common. Young plants are not fire resistant and should be protected from grazing.
Apiculture:  Flowers are reputed to produce bee forage.
The large pods as well as the wood are used for fuel.
Timber:  The sapwood is light yellow, and the heartwood is yellowish to light brown. It is soft, heavy (specific gravity 0.8), coarse grained, weak, brittle, takes good polish and is rather resistant to moisture and insects although very susceptible to attack by dry-wood termites.
Shade or shelter: D. regia is planted as a shade tree in dairy farms, tea plantations and compounds.
Medicine: Bark has medicinal properties.
Gum or resin:  The tree yields a thick mucilage of water-soluble of gum in yellowish or reddish-brown warty tears; the seeds contain gum that may find use in textile and food industries.
Ornamental:  It is mainly valued as a decorative tree, often being planted in avenues and gardens.
D. regia can be planted as live fence posts."

In tests in the Philippines, tissue culture of D. elliptica was found to be not viable due to low explant decontamination, retarded shoot regeneration for alcohol propagation and unsuccesful shoot regeneration from calli.  Tissue culture to obtain rotenoids appears to be rather difficult.  When leaves of D. elliptica were used for callus induction, only trace amounts of rotenoids (3 microgram/g on dry weight basis) were detected in the tissue subcultured for 4 months.  Rotenoids biosynthesis decreased with frequent subcultures of callus tissue, was finally lost.  Callus with imperfectly differentiated rootlets induced from the leaves or stems by regulating plant hormones contained rotenoids which were identified as rotenone and deguelin.  The rotenone content was 160 microgram/g on dry weight basis.  In other experiments in the Philippines root regeneration from calli induced from internodes, nodes and axillary buds of D. elliptica was obtained 3-5 weeks after inoculation on Shenck and Hildebrandt's medium supplemented with naphthalene acetic acid.  Using Durham's test for rotenone, 60-100% of the calli and regenerated roots showed a positive reaction.
Poison: D. elliptica is used as a fish poison throughout southern Asia and the Pacific.  The pounded root is considered the strongest fish poison in South-East Asia.  Rotenone is used in fisheries in the Philippines, Bangladesh and India to remove predatory and other undesired fish from rearing pods.  An extract from the roots of D. elliptica is reported to be employed as an ingredient of arrow poison in Borneo.  The powdered root of D. elliptica is widely used as an insecticide.
Medicine: D. elliptica is traditionally used for antisepsis and applied to abscesses and against leprosy and itch, and sometimes as an abortifacient.  In Thailand, the roots are also used as emmenagogue and the stems as a blood tonic."

Dialium guineense,"Local names:
 English (tumble tree,black velvet,Sierra Leone tamarind,velvet tamarind), French (tamarinier noir,dialium de Guinée,afambeau), Fula (meko,kedebe,mako,mekohi), Igbo (icheku), Mandinka (kosito), Wolof (solam,solom), Yoruba (awin)
Dialium guineense is a tree to 30 m high, with a densely leafy crown, but often shrubby. Bole without buttresses, Bark smooth, grey; slash reddish, yielding a little red gum.

Leaves sometimes finely hairy, with a common stalk 5-13 cm long, with an odd terminal leaflet and usually 2 pairs of opposite or alternate leaflets, the lower pair being somewhat smaller; leaflets mostly 3.5-10 x 2.5-5 cm, elliptic to broadly elliptic, sometimes slightly obovate; blunt at the apex or abruptly and shortly acuminate, symmetrical and rounded or slightly cuneate at the base; leathery, glabrous above and with the midrib slightly sunken, sometimes finely hairy beneath.

Flowers usually whitish, in large terminal, or occasionally axillary, panicles up to 30 cm long; branches spreading out widely and more or less horizontally; the whole infloresence at first covered with very short, brownish hairs; individual flowers with short stout stalks, the buds about 2 mm long.

Fruits usually abundant, more or less circular and flattened, but sometimes almost globose, up to 2.5 cm in diameter, densely velvety, black; each fruit with a stalk about 6 mm long with a little collar near the apex, with a brittle shell enclosing 1 seed (or exceptionally 2), embedded in a dry, brownish, sweetly acidic, edible pulp.

The origin of the generic name is not known; J. E. Smith, a noted 18th century English botanist, sought it and could not discover it, nor have modern botanists. 

The specific name means ‘of Guinea’.
Ecology

D. guineense grows in dense savannah forests, shadowy canyons and gallery forests. It is found from Senegal to Sudan along the southern border of the Sahel. This is the most common and widespread Dialium in Nigeria. In Ghana, D. guineense is found along transition zones bordering high forest, in riverian forest of the savannah woodland, in coastal scrub, and in riparian vegetation of the Volta near Ada.

Tree management

Harvesting the trees is difficult because the wood is dense. They often have tall buttresses, which have to be slashed before cutting, as much of the wood would be wasted if the trunk were cut above the buttress. The logs cannot be transported by river as they sink in water.

Mechanical scarification is the best treatment to promote germination. The seeds can be sown in beds containing a mixture of equal parts of forest topsoil and river sand. They are buried just below the soil surface and a layer of sawdust is spread on top. The beds should be shaded and watered regularly (twice a day). During germination, the testa breaks at soil level, exposing the creamy white, thick cotyledons. Seedlings with epigeal germination.
  The pulp is red, with a sweet-sour, astringent flavour similar to baobab, but sweeter. It is peeled and eaten raw; it can be a little constipating. The thirst-quenching, refreshing fruit pulp can also be soaked in water and drunk as a beverage. Leaves are bitter; they may be used to cook ‘domoda’, a Ghanaian dish that tastes both sweet and bitter.
The tree is said to make good firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  Sapwood is white with distinct ripple marks; the heartwood is red-brown. Because of the high silicate content of the timber, axes and saws quickly get blunt. The wood is hard, durable, heavy, light brown, with a fine texture. It is used for vehicles, houses and flooring.
Medicine:  Bark and leaves are used against several diseases."
Dichrostachys cinerea,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (sekelbos), Amharic (ader,ergett-dimmo), Arabic (hurgam,kaddad,kadada,hurgan,heghem,hegam,um Kedad,kadad), Bemba (kansalonsalo,katenge), English (sickle bush,marabou thorn,Chinese lantern tree,kalahari Christmas tree,bell mimosa), French (mimos
Dichrostachys cinerea is a semi-deciduous to deciduous tree up to 7 m tall with an open crown. Bark on young branches green and hairy but dark grey-brown and longitudinally fissured on older branches and stems; smooth on spines formed from modified side shoots. Slash cream coloured to light yellow. Strong alternate thorns, up to 8 cm long, almost at right angles, slightly recurved, grow out of the branches and may bear leaves at the base. Twigs grey brown violet, with prominent light lenticels.

Leaves bipinnate; rachis 4-8 cm, with 5-15 (max. 19) pairs of pinnae, which each bear (min. 9) 12-22 (max. 41) pairs of leaflets; terminal pair of pinnae shorter, dark green, underside pale. Leaflets about 8 x 2.5 mm wide; leaflets and petioles very tomentose and ciliate. 

Flowers very characteristic in bicoloured cylindrical, dense, petioled, pendulous spikes (bottlebrush), 6-8 cm long and fragrant. Terminal lower flowers hermaphroditic, with 1 pistil and 10 yellow stamens each. Upper flowers of a hanging spike are sterile, reddish or pale purple, with protruding staminodes.

Pods narrow, yellow or brown; generally twisted or spiralled, up to 100 x 15 mm, in dense, stalked, intertwined clusters; indehiscent. About 4 black seeds with a spot at one end per pod.

It seems possible that 2 subspecies can be recognized: D. cinerea. ssp. africana and D. cinerea ssp. nyassana . The latter tends to grow larger and has larger and less hairy leaves and leaflets.

The generic name ‘Dichrostachys’ means ‘2-coloured spike’, and ‘cinerea’ refers to the greyish hairs of the typical subspecies, which is confined to India; from the Greek ‘konis’ and the Latin ‘cineres’. In South Africa it is called the ‘Kalahari Christmas tree’, and because of the attractive 2-coloured hanging flowers some people call it ‘tassels for the chief’s hat’. But most commonly it is known as the ‘sickle bush’, because the young pods are curved like sickles.
Ecology

D. cinerea penetrates clear-cut areas far into the rainforest zone. In Malaysia, it occurs in areas with strong seasonal climate, usually on poor, occasionally clayey soils, in brushwood, thickets, hedges, teak forest and grassland. Forms dense hammocks on lateritic soils in Senegal and Sudan, while in India it occurs in dry deciduous forest. It can be an indicator of overgrazing in low rainfall areas. Usually not frost resistant and tolerance is less on poor soils, but definitely drought resistant. It is fire resistant and does not tolerate waterlogging.  It is a weedy species. For instance in Cuba, the tree is unchecked and forms veritable forests on hill land or in areas on which cane growing has been discontinued. In some parts of central Cuba, there are reports that whole farms have been rendered useless by this foreign weed.

Tree management

It grows at a medium to slow rate, 6-8 cm/year. For fuelwood plantations, dune stabilization, ravine afforestation, or erosion control, the spacing should be 3 x 5 m; for silvopasture, 8 x 8 m. Dense plantings help stabilize gully plugs and check-dams. To get maximum fuel biomass, the plants should be harvested at 10 years. However, if the production objective is only fodder, trees should be coppiced every other year after reaching about 5-6 m in height. The plant has moderately vigorous coppicing ability and can also be pollarded and lopped. A plant in the range of 7-8.5 cm collar diameter is suitable for coppicing, and the whole plant can be harvested 15 cm above ground level. The number of regenerated shoots varies between 5 and 9, of which 2-3 branches attain better growth in height, diameter and biomass.

For soil conservation, the species should not be disturbed in any way. Its prolific root suckers will then provide natural spread for complete ground cover within a few years. Later a fodder harvest can be taken by lopping leaves and pods. In the 6th year, the total aboveground biomass is about 31 kg (dry). Thus an average yield of 3.4 t (1.2 t dry) fodder and 22.8 t (11.1 t dry) firewood may be expected on the 6th year from 1 ha of wasteland. It yields about 1 kg of seed pods/tree.

D. cinerea enroaches rapidly on overgrazed, trampled ground and on old lands where the grass cover has been removed. It is difficult to eradicate as it shoots again from portions of root. In certain situations, mechanical or chemical control measures are the only ways to control the potentially serious weed.
Orthodox seed storage behaviour; little loss in viability during 26 years of hermetic storage at room temperature. Add ash to stored seed to reduce insect damage. Can be stored for up to 10 years at room temperature if kept dry and free from insects. There are 50 500-66 500 seeds/kg.

In some parts of central Cuba, there are reports that whole farms have been rendered useless by this foreign weed.
Natural regeneration is strongest by root suckers. Within a period of 10 years, an individual of this species can produce 130 new stems in a radius of 15 m by its root suckers. Artificial propagation by transplanting root suckers or by using root cuttings is likewise the easiest and usually most successful method of propagation.

Direct sowing of seed is also possible. The freshly collected ripe seeds take long to germinate (15-20 days), mainly due to a thick seed coat. Scarified seeds give better germination, and a pretreatment of 25 minutes in concentrated sulphuric acid gives optimum germination of 3-7 days for freshly collected seeds. Three-year-old seeds require only a 15-minute pretreatment for optimum germination. Under controlled conditions, more than 75% germination may be expected. As soon as the pods ripen on the tree, they should be collected and the seeds taken out, dried and stored. This way, a reasonable amount of seeds could be saved from insect attack. About 1 million seeds/year are expected from a plant and most of the seeds are viable.
Owing to its strong capacity for natural regeneration, it has high potential for ravine afforestation and other soil conservation purposes on difficult sites.
Erosion control:  The plant is widely used for sand dune stabilization and soil conservation; in India, it is recommended for shallow soils, arid western and subhumid alluvial plains and highly degraded calcareous wastelands.
  Fruit and seeds from D. cinerea are edible.
Cattle, camels and game (giraffe, buffalo, kudu, Lichtenstein’s hartebeest, nyala, impala, klipspringer, red duiker and Damara dik-dik) relish the juicy pods that drop to the ground and even eat the young twigs and leaves. Leaves are highly palatable, rich in protein (11-15% crude protein) and mineral content. Young shoots and pods are also browsed by smaller domestic animals. Pods and seeds do not contain hydrocyanic acid, minimizing the chance of poisoning animals.
Apiculture:  The flowers are a valuable honey source.
The wood is dense, burns slowly with few sparks and emits a non-toxic smoke, making it excellent firewood. It often grows many small trunks, ideal in size for carrying in a headload.
Fibre:  The bark yields a strong fibre used for various applications such as twine. The debarked roots are used for strong plaiting work such as for racks and baskets.
Timber: D. cinerea yields a medium to heavy, durable hardwood with a density of 600-1190 kg/cubic m at 15% mc. Heartwood red or dark purple with darker streaks, sharply differentiated from the yellowish-brown sapwood; grain straight or slightly interlocked; texture rather fine and even. Due to its generally small dimensions, its utilization is limited making such items as walking sticks, handles, spears and tool handles. Fencing posts are durable and termite resistant, easily lasting up to 50 years.
Medicine: The bark is used to treat dysentery, headaches, toothaches, elephantiasis and acts as a vermifuge. Root infusions are taken for leprosy, syphilis coughs, as an anthelmintic, purgative and strong diuretic. Pounded roots and leaves are used to treat epilepsy. The roots are chewed and placed on the sites of snakebites and scorpion stings, and the leaves, which are believed to produce a local anaesthesia, are used for the same purpose and also as a remedy for sore eyes and toothache. Leaves are taken as a diuretic and laxative, and used for gonorrhoea and boils; powder from leaves is used in the massage of fractures. The plant is used as a veterinary medicine in India.
Nitrogen fixing: D. cinerea fixes atmospheric nitrogen.
Ornamental:  The sickle bush can be planted in the garden to show off the beautiful pink and yellow lantern flowers during early summer and the interesting branching pattern during winter. A favourite plant to train as a bonsai.
Thorn branch enclosures prevent livestock from straying at night and protect vegetable gardens, cash crops and fodder- or thatch-grass reserves from livestock. Since it is difficult to control, having an aggressive weedy c
Soil improver:  The leaves, rich in nutrients, are frequently used as a green manure. In the Sahel, particularly along riverbanks, it is said to improve soils.
Intercropping:  Highly compatible with certain improved arid-zone grass and forage species such as Cenchrus ciliaris, Lasiurus sindicus and Stylosanthes hamata, making it well suited to silvoipastoral systems."
Didymopanax morototoni,"Local names:

Didymopanax morototoni is a medium-sized tree 8-30 m in height, with a cylinder-shaped bole that is straight and may reach up to 80 cm in diameter at the base; crown small with ramification only at the apex; branches not numerous; has scars on the leaf peduncles. Bark whitish and has a smooth surface.

Leaves large, compound, digitate, 15-40 cm long, alternate; petiole long, 30-60 cm, with well-developed stipules, inserted obliquely on the stem; 10-11 folioles, with elliptical lance-shaped limb, acuminate, undulate, sinuate on the margin, semi-coriaceous, dark-green on the upper surface, brown-red and heavily pilose underneath.

Flower clusters (panicled umbels) lateral, about 20-60 cm long and broad, with branches grey and finely hairy. Flowers very numerous in numerous small, rounded clusters (umbels) less than 1.3 cm across, on spreading flower stalks 1.6-4.7 mm long. The pentamerous, finely brownish and grey hairy flower about 4.7 mm across has a minute basal tube (hypanthium) less than 1.6 mm long enclosing the inferior ovary and bearing the minute 5-toothed calyx; petals 5, white, pointed, more than 1.6 mm long; stamens 5 and styles 2.

Fruit a fleshy berry, grey and covered with a bloom, about 4-9 mm long and 6-12 mm broad; slightly flattened, with 2 styles at apex. It contains 2 oblong, flat brown seeds 4.7 mm long.
Ecology

Frequently found in the upland forests and in old open woodlands. In Peru, it is common on the savannah margins. It prefers open forests with abundant light. Widespread in the wet forests of tropical America.

Tree management

At 3 years of age, better growth in height has been obtained at a 3 x 2 m spacing and the larger diameter at a 4 x 4 m spacing. Production of 15-18 cubic m/ha per year in uniform stands can be expected.

D. morototoni demands strong light and is abundant in openings, secondary forests and on roadsides. These locations are susceptible to fire in dry periods, and the species is favoured essentially due to its fire-resistant seeds.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; no loss in viability following 11 months of storage at 12 deg. C with seeds in equilibrium with 30% r.h. There are approximately 45 400 seeds/kg.
Frequently found in the upland forests and in old open woodlands. In Peru, it is common on the savannah margins. It prefers open forests with abundant light. Widespread in the wet forests of tropical America.
The seedlings are easy to transplant, and the trees may also reproduce by coppicing. Soon after field burning, which practically cleans the soil, the seeds germinate.
Fibre:  The use of D. morototoni in the pulp and paper industry is increasing.
Timber:  Its moderately heavy wood is coloured light cream with some grey, with regular grain; medium texture, shiny and smooth surface and is easily worked with a fine finish. In Puerto Rico, the wood is little used, although it is especially suitable for boxes and crates. Where the trees are more abundant and larger in size, uses include for general carpentry, interior construction and boxes. In Trinidad and British Guyana, the wood is made into matchsticks and matchboxes. Other possible uses are utility grade plywood, toys, and as a substitute for heavier grades of balsa. 
Medicine:  The leaves have been known to serve as home remedies.
Ornamental: D. morototoni is a tree with ornamental possibilities due to its rapid growth and handsome aspects."
Dimocarpus longan,"Local names:
 English (lungan,longan tree,longan,dragon's eye), French (longanier), German (Longanbaum), Spanish (mamoncillo chino,longan)
Dimocarpus longan is handsome, erect, 9-12 m in height and 14 m in width, with rough-barked trunk 76.2 cm thick and long, spreading, slightly drooping, heavily foliaged branches.

Leaves evergreen, alternate, paripinnate, 4-10 opposite leaflets, elliptic, ovate-oblong or lanceolate, blunt-tipped; 10-20 cm long and 3.5-5 cm wide; leathery, wavy, glossy-green on the upper surface, minutely hairy and greyish-green beneath. New growth is wine-colored and showy.

Flowers pale-yellow, 5-6-petalled, hairy-stalked, larger than those of the closely related species, Litchi chinensis (lychee), are borne in upright terminal panicles, male and female mingled.

Fruits, globose in drooping clusters, 1.25-2.5 cm in diameter, with thin, brittle, yellow-brown to light reddish-brown rind, more or less rough (pebbled), the protuberances much less prominent than those of the lychee. The flesh (aril) is mucilaginous, whitish, translucent, somewhat musky, sweet, but not as sweet as that of the lychee and with less ""bouquet"". 

Seed round, jet-black, shining, with a circular white spot at the base, giving it the aspect of an eye.
Ecology

The longan is native to southern China, in the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Schezwan and Fukien, between elevations of 150-450 m. It thrives much better on higher ground than the lychee and endures more frost. It is rarely found growing along the dykes of streams as is the lychee but does especially well on high ground near ponds. The longan appears in these regions more often but it, too, cannot stand heavy frosts. After a long period of cool weather over the 3 winter months, with no frost, longan trees bloom well. Blooming is poor after a warm winter.
Native range
China, India, Myanmar
Tree management

A tree can be converted to a preferred cultivar by cutting it drastically back and veneer-grafting the new shoots. In China, if the longan is raised on the lowlands it is always put on the edges of raised beds. On high ground, the trees are placed in pre-enriched holes on the surface. The trees are fertilized after the fruit harvest and during the blooming season, at which time the proportion of nitrogen is reduced. Fresh, rich soil is added around the base of the trees year after year. The longan needs an adequate supply of water and can even stand brief flooding, but not prolonged drought. Irrigation is necessary in dry periods. 

Pruning of many flower-bearing twigs where 3/4 of the flower spikes in the cluster are removed is essential. Later, the fruit clusters are also thinned, in order to increase the size and quality of the fruits. 

In China, full-grown trees given sufficient room–at least 12 m apart–may yield 180-225 kg in good years. Crops in Florida from trees 6 m tall, have varied from light 22.5-45 kg–to medium–68-113 kg, and heavy–135-225 kg. Rarely such trees may produce 272-317 kg. Larger trees have larger crops but if the trees become too tall harvesting is too difficult, and they should be topped. A serious problem with the longan is its irregular bearing–often one good year followed by 1 or 2 poor years.
Seeds are recalcitrant. They lose viability at 18 % moisture content. There is 70 % survival after 7 weeks storage with anesthetic substances such as moist storage at 8-10 deg C with 100 % relative humidity and with 80 % nitrous oxide + 20 % oxygen, but no viability when water is used; and 67 % germination after 250 days moist storage in moist (20 % moisture content) perlite + 4 % chlorthalonil, at 15 deg C.
The longan is native to southern China, in the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Schezwan and Fukien, between elevations of 150-450 m. It thrives much better on higher ground than the lychee and endures more frost. It is rarely found growing along the dykes of streams as is the lychee but does especially well on high ground near ponds. The longan appears in these regions more often but it, too, cannot stand heavy frosts. After a long period of cool weather over the 3 winter months, with no frost, longan trees bloom well. Blooming is poor after a warm winter.
Most longan trees are grown from seed. After drying in the shade for 4 days, they should be planted without delay, but no more than 2 cm deep, otherwise they may send up more than one sprout. Germination takes place within 7-10 days. The seedlings are transplanted to shaded nursery rows the following spring and set in the field 2-3 years later during winter dormancy. Vegetative propagation is undertaken, by means of inarching, nearly always onto 'Wu Yuan' trees 3-5 years old and 1.5-1.8 m high. The union is made no less than 1.2 m from the ground because it is most convenient. Grafting is uncommon, whip-grafting has given 80% success in Taiwan. Air layering is done frequently. Air-layers bear in 2-3 years after planting.
 Longans are much eaten fresh, out-of-hand, but some have maintained that the fruit is improved by cooking. In China, the majority are canned in syrup or dried. The canned fruits were regularly shipped from Shanghai to the United States in the past. Today, they are exported from Hong Kong and Taiwan. For drying, the fruits are first heated to shrink the flesh and facilitate peeling of the rind. Then the seeds are removed and the flesh dried over a slow fire. The dried product is black, leathery and smoky in flavor and is mainly used to prepare an infusion drunk for refreshment.
The seeds and the rind are burnt for fuel. The wood is not highly valued for fuel.
Timber: While the tree is not often cut for timber, the wood is used for posts, agricultural implements, furniture and construction. The heartwood is red, hard, and takes a fine polish.
Shade or shelter: The longan is cultivated in Bengal and elsewhere as a shade tree.
Medicine: The flesh of the fruit is administered as a stomachic, febrifuge and vermifuge, and is regarded as an antidote for poison. A decoction of the dried flesh is taken as a tonic and treatment for insomnia and neurasthenic neurosis. In both North and South Vietnam, the ""eye"" of the longan seed is pressed against a snakebite in the belief that it will absorb the venom. Leaves and flowers are sold in Chinese herb markets but are not a part of ancient traditional medicine. The leaves contain quercetin and quercitrin. Dried flowers are exported to Malaysia for medicinal purposes. The seeds are administered to counteract heavy sweating and the pulverized kernel, which contains saponin, tannin and fat, serves as a styptic. 
Ornamental: The tree is widely cultivated as an ornamental.
Alcohol: A liqueur is made by macerating the longan flesh in alcohol. "

Diospyros kaki,"Local names:
 English (persimmon,oriental persimmon,keg fig,kaki plum tree,Chinese fig,Chinese plum,Japanese persimmon,date plum), French (kaki,Plaqueminier kaki), German (Kakipflaumenbaum), Italian (cachi), Japanese (kaki), Spanish (kaki del Japon,caqui,kaki)
Diospyros kaki is a multi-stemmed or sometimes single-stemmed deciduous tree up to 6(-18) m tall and typically round-topped, fairly open, erect or semi-erect, sometimes crooked or willowy; seldom with a spread of more than 4.5-6 m. Branches somewhat brittle and can be damaged in high winds.

Leaves alternate, entire, ovate-elliptic, oblong-ovate, or obovate, 7.5-25 cm long, 5-10 cm wide, leathery, glossy on the upper surface, brown-silky beneath; bluish-green, turning in the fall to rich yellow, orange or red; petioles 2 cm long, brown-hairy.

Flowers inconspicuous surrounded by a green calyx tube, borne in leaf axils of new growth from one-year old wood. Female flowers solitary, cream-colored; male flowers pink-tinged, borne in threes. Commonly, 1-5 flowers per twig emerge as the new growth extends. 

Fruit round, conical, oblate, or nearly square, capped by the persistent calyx, skin thin, smooth, glossy, yellow, orange, red or brownish-red; flesh yellow, orange, or dark-brown, juicy, gelatinous, seedless or containing 4-8 seeds. Generally, the flesh is bitter and astringent until fully ripe, when it becomes soft, sweet and pleasant, but dark-fleshed types may be non-astringent, crisp, sweet and edible even before full ripening.

Seed flat, oblong, brown, 2 cm long.

From the Greek diospyros, composed of dios (divine), and pyros (grain), from the edible fruit of some species. The specific epithet is derived from the Japanese word for plant, kaki-no-ki.
Ecology

D. kaki needs a subtropical to mild-temperate climate. It may not fruit in tropical lowlands. In Brazil, the tree is considered suitable for all zones favourable to Citrus, but those zones with the coldest winters induce the highest yields. The atmosphere may range from semi-arid to one of high humidity.
Native range
China, India, Japan, Myanmar
Tree management

The soil should be well prepared–deeply plowed and enriched with organic matter. Trees should be set out at spacing ranging from 4.5 x l.5 m to 6 x 6 m, depending on the habit of the cultivar. In Japan, 1 000 plants/ha may be planted at the outset, and thinned down to 200 trees/ha in 10-15 years.

Good results have been obtained with a fertilizer mixture of 4-6% N, 8-10% P and 3-6% K at the rate of 0.45 kg/tree per year of age. Over-fertilization or excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer causes shedding of fruits.

Young trees are pruned back to 0.7-0.9 m when planted and later the new shoots are thinned with a view to forming a well-shaped tree. Annual pruning during the first 4-5 winters is desirable in some cultivars. If a tree tends to overbear and shows signs of decline, it should be drastically cut back to give it a fresh start. After flowering, the trees should be irrigated every 3 weeks on light soil, every month on heavier soil, until time for harvest. The annual yield of a young tree ranges from 22.6-40.8 kg; of a full-grown tree, 150-250 kg.
Stratification is recommended for all persimmon seeds.

In Brazil, the tree is considered suitable for all zones favourable to Citrus, but those zones with the coldest winters induce the highest yields. The atmosphere may range from semi-arid to one of high humidity.
Propagation is by seed, root suckers or grafting onto wild rootstocks. Seeds for the production of rootstocks need no pretreatment. They are planted in seedbeds or directly in the nursery 20-30 cm apart and 0.9-1.06 m between the rows. After a season of growth, they may be whip-grafted close to the surface of the soil, using freshly cut scions or scions from dormant trees kept moist in sphagnum moss.

Cleft grafting is preferred on larger stock and for top-working old trees. In India, cleft-grafting on stem has been 88.9% successful, low germination rates of planted seeds has been traced to dry rot caused by Penicillium sp. It can be controlled by pretreatment with an appropriate fungicide.
Poison:  Juice of small, inedible wild fruits, crushed whole, calyx, seeds and all, is diluted with water and painted on paper or cloth as an insect- and moisture-repellent.
  Fully ripe fruits are usually eaten out-of-hand. The flesh may be added to salads, blended with ice cream mix or yoghurt, used in pastries, puddings, mousse, or made into jam or marmalade. Ripe fruits can be frozen whole or pulped. Drying is commonly practiced. Roasted seeds have served as a coffee substitute. Tea can also be made from fresh or dried leaves. Kaki is high in vitamin and a moderate source of ascorbic acid.
Timber:  Wood fairly hard and heavy, black with streaks of orange-yellow, salmon, brown or grey; close-grained; takes a smooth finish and is prized in Japan for fancy inlays, though it has an unpleasant odor.
Tannin or dyestuff: Tannin from unripe fruits has been employed in brewing sake, also in dyeing and as a wood preservative. 
Medicine: A decoction of the calyx and fruit stem is sometimes taken to relieve hiccups, coughs and labored respiration.
Ornamental:  It is a handsome ornamental with drooping leaves and branches that give it a languid, rather tropical appearance.
Trees can be planted as a hedge or as a screen if pruned heavily.
Alcohol:  Fruit may be converted into molasses, cider, beer and wine."
Diospyros melanoxylon,"Local names:
 Bengali (kendu,kend), English (coromandel ebony persimmon,ebony), Gujarati (tamrug,tamru), Hindi (abnus,tendu,nallatumki,timburni,kendu,karundumbi), Nepali (abnush,tendu), Sanskrit (dirghapatraka), Tamil (karai,tumbi,tumki,thumbi,karundumbi), Trade name
Diospyros melanoxylon is a medium-sized tree or shrub up to 25 m, and 1.9 m girth. The bark is pelican in colour, exfoliating in rectangular scales. The primary root is long, thick and fleshy at first, afterwards woody, greyish, often swollen in upper part near ground level. The roots form vertical loops in sucker-generated plants.

Leaves opposite or alternate and coriaceus, up to 35 cm long, tomentose on both sides when young, becoming glabrous above when fully grown.

Male flowers are mauve in colour, tetramerous to sextamerous, 1-1.5 cm long, sessile or nearly sessile in short peduncles, mostly 3-flowered. Female flowers mauve, mostly extra-axillary or sometimes solitary, axillary generally 2, opposite each other, larger than the male flowers.

Fruits olive green, ovoid or globose 3-4 cm across; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 8-seeded berries. Pulp yellow, soft and sweet. Seeds compressed, oblong, shiny, often banded.

The generic name is derived from the Greek ‘dios’ (divine), and ‘pyros’ (fruit), referring to the excellent fruit of the genus. The specific name is Greek and means ‘dark wood’.
Ecology

D. melanoxylon demands light; it is drought and frost hardy but sensitive to waterlogging. It is normally found in a dry deciduous forest as a constituent species of Tectona grandis, sal and mixed forests of Acacia leucophlea, Boswellia serrata, Butea monosperma, Lannea coromandelica and Terminalia tomentosa.
Native range
India, Nepal, Pakistan
Tree management

The tree is usually kept reserved and is not felled except in clear-felling coupes, as in the coppice-with-reserves working cycle in India. The main source of production of bidi leaves is from the bushes arising from the root suckers; leaves of bigger trees are stiff and brittle and therefore not capable of producing trade leaves for wrapping bidis. The seedlings are normally planted at 2 m by 2 m. Where the objective of management is the production of leaves, heavy pruning is recommended as this promotes vegetative growth and the production of relatively large and thin leaves, although repeated pruning can cause stunted growth of trees. Plants up to 15 cm in girth are cut near the ground to encourage sprouting of coppice shoots, which gives best quality leaves after 40-50 days of operation. Coppicing experiments in India show that best quality of trade leaves are obtained by coppicing flush to the ground level twice, 2 weeks apart, then coppicing flush to the ground only once.

The tree also pollards well, although the growth of the pollard shoots is slow. Pollarding is done to obtain a good flush of tender leaves, and plants over 15 cm girth are usually cut at 60-90 cm height. The quality of the leaves also depends on whether the frequency and intensity of pollarding impairs the vitality and growth of the trees.

Management for small timber, poles or firewood requires a coppice rotation of about 30 years to give usable products. For ebony wood, a much longer rotation would be needed to give sufficient dimensions to the valuable heartwood.
Orthodox seed storage behaviour; viability maintained for 1 year in open storage; viability lost within 1 year in hermetic storage at room temperature with 11-15% mc. About 5 kg of ripe fruit yields 1 kg of seeds, weighing 1100-2 000 seeds/kg.
D. melanoxylon demands light; it is drought and frost hardy but sensitive to waterlogging. It is normally found in a dry deciduous forest as a constituent species of Tectona grandis, sal and mixed forests of Acacia leucophlea, Boswellia serrata, Butea monosperma, Lannea coromandelica and Terminalia tomentosa.
Natural regeneration is through seedlings, coppice and root suckers. Artificial propagation is through either direct seeding or planting nursery-raised seedlings. Soaking seeds for about 12 hours in cold water improves germination. Stump planting has been found to be as good as direct seeding.
  The fruits and powdered seeds are sold in local markets and eaten.
A tolerance to pruning makes D. melanoxylon a good fodder species. The leaves are reported to contain 7.12% crude protein, and 25.28% crude fibre.
D. melanoxylon is reported to be good fuelwood; calorific value of sapwood is 4957 kcal/kg and of heartwood, 5030 kcal/kg.
Timber:  Wood is hard, whitish-pink, tough, fairly durable and used for building, shoulder poles, mine props and shafts of carriages. The ebony is very heavy and valued for carving and other ornamental works. 
Medicine:  The seeds can be intoxicating; they have been prescribed in India as a cure for mental disorders, nervous breakdowns and palpitations of the heart. The fruits have a cooling and an astringent effect. Dried flowers are reportedly useful in urinary, skin and blood diseases. The bark is astringent; its decoction is used in diarrhoea.
Intercropping:  The results of regular cultivation of D. melanoxylon mixed with agricultural crops is not known. Its cultivation on field boundaries or distributed in field crops, such as oilseed and cereal crops, appears to be a feasible and attractive proposition. Its deep tap-rooting habit would minimize competition with annual crops. Planting may be done in rows that are about 10 m apart with plants about 3 m apart in rows.
Other services: D. melanoxylon leaves possess unrivaled qualities of flavour, colour, flexible and leathery texture, decay resistance and easy workability, which make them admirably suitable for wrapping bidis."
Dalbergia sissoo,"Local names:
 Arabic (dalbergia,sissoo), Bengali (shisu,shishu,sisu), English (Bombay blackwood,sissoo,Indian rosewood,sisso), Hindi (agaru,biridi,tali,gette,kara,shisham,sisam,sissai,sissu,sissoo), Indonesian (pradu-khaek,du-khaek), Javanese (sonowaseso), Nepali (sis
Dalbergia sissoo is a medium to large-sized deciduous tree, growing up to 30 m in height and 80 cm dbh under favourable conditions. Crown wide spreading and thin. Bark thin, grey, longitudinally furrowed, exfoliating in narrow strips. Develops a long taproot from an early age, and numerous lateral ramifying roots.

The leaves are imparipinate; leaflets 3-5, alternate, 2.5-3.6 cm in diameter, broad ovate, acuminate, glabrescent, petiolules 3-5 mm long. 

Flowers 5-8 mm long, pale white to dull yellow, racemes 2.5-3.7 cm long in short axillary panicles. 

Pods 5-7.5 cm x 8-13 mm, narrowed at the base, indehiscent, glabrous, with 1-4 seeds. Seeds 6-8 x 4-5 mm, kidney shaped, thin and flat, light brown.

The generic name Dalbergia honours the Swedish brothers Nils and Carl Dalberg, who lived in the 18th century. The former was a botanist and the latter explored Surinam.
Ecology

Abundant moisture and lack of competition are the key to its successful regeneration; it is therefore found in riverine environments where sunlight and moisture are plentiful. Associated with Pinus roxburghii, Acacia catechu and Shorea robusta. D. sissoo is adapted to a seasonal monsoon climate and a dry season of up to 6 months.
Native range
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Malaysia, Pakistan
Tree management

A fast-growing species; growth rates of 3.7 m in 1 year, 5 m in 3 years, 11 m in 5 years and 15 m in 10 years have been recorded. D. sissoo plantations are established in block or strip plantations at 1.8 x 1.8 m to 4 x 4 m. Closer spacing is used for straight timber of good quality. When the canopy closes, at about 6 years, 30-40% of the stems are thinned to selectively remove suppressed, diseased and badly formed trees. Thinning is recommended every 10 years where the rotation is 30-60 years. There is evidence that the stumps begin to lose vigour after 2 or 3 rotations when managed as a coppice crop. It coppices vigorously up to about 20 years of age.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability is maintained for 4 years in hermetic storage and 1-2 years when stored in airtight containers under dry, cool (5-22 deg. C) conditions. There are approximately 45 000-55 000 seeds/kg.
Abundant moisture and lack of competition are the key to its successful regeneration; it is therefore found in riverine environments where sunlight and moisture are plentiful. Associated with Pinus roxburghii, Acacia catechu and Shorea robusta. D. sissoo is adapted to a seasonal monsoon climate and a dry season of up to 6 months.
While seeds may be sown without pretreatment, it is recommended that they be soaked in water at room temperature for 24-48 hr, inoculated with Rhizobium after soaking and sown immediately. D. sissoo rarely regenerates under the parent canopy. Natural regeneration is nonetheless abundant along streams and riverbanks where the pods have been carried by floods. Ripe pods may be collected manually by climbing trees and picking the fruits or by shaking the branches and picking the fruits from the ground. Propagation by root suckers is done best by cutting stems just below the soil surface. While it is difficult to propagate using stem and branch cuttings without hormone treatments, exogenous application of auxins (IAA, IBA and NAA) have been found to improve survival and growth rates.
Poison: Dalbergia sissoo is reported to have pesticidal properties. Aqueous extracts from the leaves, stems and roots inhibit the reproduction, growth and development of the insect pest Utethesia pulchella. Mixed with Azadirachta indica oil cake, sawdust from D. sissoo reduces egg laying and increases larval mortality in Melodogyne javanica. Methanol extract from the roots has insecticidal properties, especially against Diacrisia obliqua, Spodoptera litura and Argina cubrania.
Due to its vigorous reproduction through suckers, it is useful for stabilizing eroding sites. It is therefore found in a variety of wastelands, like in south Asia, where it is known as a colonizing species.
Young branches and foliage form an excellent fodder with a dry-matter content of 32.46%, crude protein 2.7-24.1%. The foliage has normally been used as emergency feed when other fodder sources fail.
Apiculture:  A useful source of honey but the flowers are only lightly attached to the flower branch and fall easily. The bees are therefore not able to take full advantage of the large number of flowers. The honey produced is dark amber with a strong fla
The species is fast growing, hence suitable for firewood. Sapwood and heartwood have calorific values of 4.9 and 5.2 kcal/g respectively.
Fibre:  Sulphate pulp from wood is used in producing writing and printing paper.
Timber: Dalbergia sissoo is one of the most useful timber species of India. The heartwood is very hard and close grained with a specific gravity of 0.62-0.82. It seasons well and does not warp or split; it is extremely durable and is one of the timbers least susceptible to dry-wood termites in India. Wood offers resistance to sawing and cutting but is excellent for turnery, takes a good polish and finishes to a smooth surface. It is used for high-quality furniture, cabinets, decorative veneer, marine and aircraft grade plywood, ornamental turnery, carving, engraving, tool handles and sporting goods. Its root wood is used for tobacco pipes. In village industry, D. sissoo is popular for doors and windows.
Shade or shelter:  Used as a windbreak in mango, coffee and tea plantations. These shade-loving crops also benefit from improved soil fertility under D. sissoo.
Tannin or dyestuff: Dalbergia sissoo pods contain 2% tannin.
Lipids:  Heartwood yields light brown, viscous, non-drying fixed oil (5.35%), suitable as a lubricant for heavy machinery.
Medicine:  Oil obtained from the seeds is used to cure skin diseases. The powdered wood, applied externally as a paste, is reportedly used to treat leprosy and skin diseases. The roots contain tectoridin, which is used medicinally.
Nitrogen fixing:  The tree nodulates; the nodules are moderate, globose to elongate. It therefore improves soil fertility.
Ornamental:  Widely used in urban and roadside plantings in the Indian subcontinent and in other parts of the world. It is noted as one of the most desirable trees for streets and backyards in Florida and Arizona, USA. It has been used for landscaping along the shores of the Sea of Galilee, Israel. 
Soil improver:  Heavy litter fall decomposes to enrich the soil with nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon.
Intercropping:  It may be planted as one component of a multitiered homegarden system, where it contributes several products.
Other services: Dalbergia sissoo has an unusual amenity use as a host for orchids. The sub-Himalayas, the homeland of D. sissoo, abound with a variety of orchids, many of which are known throughout the world for their beauty."

Ornamental:  D. elata is a distinct, magnificent tree in bloom, suitable for cultivation in gardens, avenues and amenity parks.
Poles from D. elata are used for fencing.
Soil improver:  D. elata leaves as a green manure are rich in Magnesium, yielding 50-200 kg of mulch per year. In Madras, India the leaves are used as mulch in rice fields.
Intercropping:  D. elata is a multipurpose tree commonly found planted or cultivated."
Delonix regia,"Local names:
 Amharic (dire dawa zaf), Arabic (goldmore), Bengali (chura,radha), Burmese (seinban), Creole (poinciana royal), English (flamboyant,gold mohur,flame of the forest,julu tree,peacock flower,flame tree,flamboyant flame tree,gul mohr,royal poinciana), French
Delonix regia is a tree 10-15 (max. 18) m high, attaining a girth of up to 2 m; trunk large, buttressed and angled towards the base; bark smooth, greyish-brown, sometimes slightly cracked and with many dots (lenticels); inner bark light brown; crown umbrella shaped, spreading with the long, nearly horizontal branches forming a diameter that is wider than the tree’s height; twigs stout, greenish, finely hairy when young, becoming brown. Roots shallow.

Leaves biparipinnate, alternate, light green, feathery, 20-60 cm long; 10-25 pairs of pinnae, 5-12 cm long, each bearing 12-40 pairs of small oblong-obtuse leaflets that are about 0.5-2 cm long and 0.3 cm wide; petiole stout. The numerous leaflets are stalkless, rounded at the base and apex, entire thin, very minutely hairy on both sides, green on the upper surface. At the base of the leaf stalk, there are 2 compressed stipules that have long, narrow, comblike teeth.

Corymbs 15-30 cm long, borne laterally near the end of the twig, each with loosely arranged, slightly fragrant flowers; flowers 5-13 cm across, with 5 equal petals, on slender stalks 5-7.6 cm long. Petals 5-6.5 cm long, 2-3 cm wide, orbicular, broadly spoon shaped, rounded but broader than long, slightly wavy-margined or crisp, tapering into claws about 2.5 cm long, widely extended and bending backwards before falling. Petals 4, orange-red, almost scarlet, 1 longer and narrower than the others, whitish inside with red spots and streaks; stalk very long, slender and hairy. Sepals 5, thick, green outside and reddish with yellow border within, reflexed when the flowers open, pointed, finely hairy, about 2.5 cm long. Stamens 5 with 10 red filaments; pistil has a hairy 1-celled ovary about 1.3 cm long and slender style about 3 cm long.

Fruit green and flaccid when young, turning to dark brown, hard, woody pods, 30-75 cm long, 3.8 cm thick, 5-7.6 cm broad, ending in a short beak when mature, with many horizontally partitioned seed chambers inside, indehiscent, finally splitting into 2 parts. The conspicuous pods hang down and remain attached most of the year even when the trees are leafless. Seeds 30-45, hard, greyish, glossy, to 2 cm long, oblong and shaped very much like date seeds, transversely mottled with a bony testa. They are arranged at right angles to the length of the pod.

The generic name, ‘Delonix’, is derived from a Greek delos (visible), and onyx (claw), in allusion to the conspicuously clawed petals. The specific name, ‘regia’, is from the Latin word ‘regis’ (royal, regal, magnificent). Most of its common names are derived from its large, flame-red flowers.
Ecology

D. regia originates from Madagascar, where it is now almost extinct. It is now widespread in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Trees can grow at higher altitudes than recommended, but flowering becomes erratic. The tree demands light and grows weakly and sparsely under shade. It grows in areas with both high and scanty rainfall. D. regia has a superficial root system and competes successfully with the neighbouring shrubs and flowering plants, rendering bare the ground under its canopy. It should therefore be planted away from other plants in the gardens. Trees are deciduous only where the dry season is long and pronounced.
Native range
Madagascar, Zambia
Tree management

D. regia can be planted in areas where rainfall is less than the recommended amount, as long as irrigation is practised. It is fast growing, and pollarding is a suitable practice. Careful pruning will achieve good crown form. The trees have shallow root systems and the wood is weak; they are therefore liable to being uprooted during strong storms and broken by strong winds. After the leaves are shed, the trees are less attractive, with their conspicuous pods remaining on the bare branches and with prominent tunnels and nests of termites that commonly attacks this species. Another objectionable feature is the surface root system, which sometimes breaks sidewalks and walls. Because of these undesirable characteristics, some authorities classify flamboyant as a tree that should not be planted.
Seeds can be stored for a long time if insect attack is avoided, which can be done by adding ash to the seeds. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox and a germination rate of 47% has been recorded after 9 years of storage at room temperature; no loss in viability following 4 years of storage. Viability is maintained following 3 years of hermetic storage at room temperature with 13-12% mc, and for at least 5 years in hermetic storage at room temperature. Average moisture of seeds is 10.45%, and there are about 2000-3245 seeds/kg.

D. regia has a superficial root system and competes successfully with the neighbouring shrubs and flowering plants, rendering bare the ground under its canopy. It should therefore be planted away from other plants in the gardens. Trees are deciduous only where the dry season is long and pronounced.
D. regia is easily propagated from seeds that have a hard, woody testa and take a long time to germinate. They may lie for 2-3 years in the soil without germinating and usually take 12-349 days to germinate. To break this dormancy, pretreatment is practised; a small portion of the seed coat is clipped, or seeds are boiled in hot water, then allowed to soak for 24 hours. After seeds are sown in unshaded nursery beds, they germinate within 5-10 days, with a germination rate of up to 90%; subsequent growth in the nursery is quite fast. Alternatively, the seeds can be directly sown in polythene bags, 4-5 seeds/bag. Seedlings watered and weeded regularly are planted out in the rainy season, with total time required in the nursery being 3-5 months. Keeping the plants for more than 9 months is not desirable, as they become too tall to handle, but seedlings can be transplanted even when 20-25 cm high. Trees can also be propagated from branch cuttings. Natural regeneration is common. Young plants are not fire resistant and should be protected from grazing.
Apiculture:  Flowers are reputed to produce bee forage.
The large pods as well as the wood are used for fuel.
Timber:  The sapwood is light yellow, and the heartwood is yellowish to light brown. It is soft, heavy (specific gravity 0.8), coarse grained, weak, brittle, takes good polish and is rather resistant to moisture and insects although very susceptible to attack by dry-wood termites.
Shade or shelter: D. regia is planted as a shade tree in dairy farms, tea plantations and compounds.

D. elliptica can survive dry periods of up to 4 months.  This species is often confined to low altitudes.
In tests in the Philippines, tissue culture of D. elliptica was found to be not viable due to low explant decontamination, retarded shoot regeneration for alcohol propagation and unsuccesful shoot regeneration from calli.  Tissue culture to obtain rotenoids appears to be rather difficult.  When leaves of D. elliptica were used for callus induction, only trace amounts of rotenoids (3 microgram/g on dry weight basis) were detected in the tissue subcultured for 4 months.  Rotenoids biosynthesis decreased with frequent subcultures of callus tissue, was finally lost.  Callus with imperfectly differentiated rootlets induced from the leaves or stems by regulating plant hormones contained rotenoids which were identified as rotenone and deguelin.  The rotenone content was 160 microgram/g on dry weight basis.  In other experiments in the Philippines root regeneration from calli induced from internodes, nodes and axillary buds of D. elliptica was obtained 3-5 weeks after inoculation on Shenck and Hildebrandt's medium supplemented with naphthalene acetic acid.  Using Durham's test for rotenone, 60-100% of the calli and regenerated roots showed a positive reaction.
Poison: D. elliptica is used as a fish poison throughout southern Asia and the Pacific.  The pounded root is considered the strongest fish poison in South-East Asia.  Rotenone is used in fisheries in the Philippines, Bangladesh and India to remove predatory and other undesired fish from rearing pods.  An extract from the roots of D. elliptica is reported to be employed as an ingredient of arrow poison in Borneo.  The powdered root of D. elliptica is widely used as an insecticide.
Medicine: D. elliptica is traditionally used for antisepsis and applied to abscesses and against leprosy and itch, and sometimes as an abortifacient.  In Thailand, the roots are also used as emmenagogue and the stems as a blood tonic."

Dialium guineense,"Local names:
 English (tumble tree,black velvet,Sierra Leone tamarind,velvet tamarind), French (tamarinier noir,dialium de Guinée,afambeau), Fula (meko,kedebe,mako,mekohi), Igbo (icheku), Mandinka (kosito), Wolof (solam,solom), Yoruba (awin)
Dialium guineense is a tree to 30 m high, with a densely leafy crown, but often shrubby. Bole without buttresses, Bark smooth, grey; slash reddish, yielding a little red gum.

Leaves sometimes finely hairy, with a common stalk 5-13 cm long, with an odd terminal leaflet and usually 2 pairs of opposite or alternate leaflets, the lower pair being somewhat smaller; leaflets mostly 3.5-10 x 2.5-5 cm, elliptic to broadly elliptic, sometimes slightly obovate; blunt at the apex or abruptly and shortly acuminate, symmetrical and rounded or slightly cuneate at the base; leathery, glabrous above and with the midrib slightly sunken, sometimes finely hairy beneath.

Flowers usually whitish, in large terminal, or occasionally axillary, panicles up to 30 cm long; branches spreading out widely and more or less horizontally; the whole infloresence at first covered with very short, brownish hairs; individual flowers with short stout stalks, the buds about 2 mm long.

Fruits usually abundant, more or less circular and flattened, but sometimes almost globose, up to 2.5 cm in diameter, densely velvety, black; each fruit with a stalk about 6 mm long with a little collar near the apex, with a brittle shell enclosing 1 seed (or exceptionally 2), embedded in a dry, brownish, sweetly acidic, edible pulp.

The origin of the generic name is not known; J. E. Smith, a noted 18th century English botanist, sought it and could not discover it, nor have modern botanists. 

The specific name means ‘of Guinea’.
Ecology

D. guineense grows in dense savannah forests, shadowy canyons and gallery forests. It is found from Senegal to Sudan along the southern border of the Sahel. This is the most common and widespread Dialium in Nigeria. In Ghana, D. guineense is found along transition zones bordering high forest, in riverian forest of the savannah woodland, in coastal scrub, and in riparian vegetation of the Volta near Ada.
Native range
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome et Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo
Tree management

Harvesting the trees is difficult because the wood is dense. They often have tall buttresses, which have to be slashed before cutting, as much of the wood would be wasted if the trunk were cut above the buttress. The logs cannot be transported by river as they sink in water.

Mechanical scarification is the best treatment to promote germination. The seeds can be sown in beds containing a mixture of equal parts of forest topsoil and river sand. They are buried just below the soil surface and a layer of sawdust is spread on top. The beds should be shaded and watered regularly (twice a day). During germination, the testa breaks at soil level, exposing the creamy white, thick cotyledons. Seedlings with epigeal germination.
  The pulp is red, with a sweet-sour, astringent flavour similar to baobab, but sweeter. It is peeled and eaten raw; it can be a little constipating. The thirst-quenching, refreshing fruit pulp can also be soaked in water and drunk as a beverage. Leaves are bitter; they may be used to cook ‘domoda’, a Ghanaian dish that tastes both sweet and bitter.
The tree is said to make good firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  Sapwood is white with distinct ripple marks; the heartwood is red-brown. Because of the high silicate content of the timber, axes and saws quickly get blunt. The wood is hard, durable, heavy, light brown, with a fine texture. It is used for vehicles, houses and flooring.
Medicine:  Bark and leaves are used against several diseases"
Dichrostachys cinerea,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (sekelbos), Amharic (ader,ergett-dimmo), Arabic (hurgam,kaddad,kadada,hurgan,heghem,hegam,um Kedad,kadad), Bemba (kansalonsalo,katenge), English (sickle bush,marabou thorn,Chinese lantern tree,kalahari Christmas tree,bell mimosa), French (mimos
Dichrostachys cinerea is a semi-deciduous to deciduous tree up to 7 m tall with an open crown. Bark on young branches green and hairy but dark grey-brown and longitudinally fissured on older branches and stems; smooth on spines formed from modified side shoots. Slash cream coloured to light yellow. Strong alternate thorns, up to 8 cm long, almost at right angles, slightly recurved, grow out of the branches and may bear leaves at the base. Twigs grey brown violet, with prominent light lenticels.

Leaves bipinnate; rachis 4-8 cm, with 5-15 (max. 19) pairs of pinnae, which each bear (min. 9) 12-22 (max. 41) pairs of leaflets; terminal pair of pinnae shorter, dark green, underside pale. Leaflets about 8 x 2.5 mm wide; leaflets and petioles very tomentose and ciliate. 

Flowers very characteristic in bicoloured cylindrical, dense, petioled, pendulous spikes (bottlebrush), 6-8 cm long and fragrant. Terminal lower flowers hermaphroditic, with 1 pistil and 10 yellow stamens each. Upper flowers of a hanging spike are sterile, reddish or pale purple, with protruding staminodes.

Pods narrow, yellow or brown; generally twisted or spiralled, up to 100 x 15 mm, in dense, stalked, intertwined clusters; indehiscent. About 4 black seeds with a spot at one end per pod.

It seems possible that 2 subspecies can be recognized: D. cinerea. ssp. africana and D. cinerea ssp. nyassana . The latter tends to grow larger and has larger and less hairy leaves and leaflets.

The generic name ‘Dichrostachys’ means ‘2-coloured spike’, and ‘cinerea’ refers to the greyish hairs of the typical subspecies, which is confined to India; from the Greek ‘konis’ and the Latin ‘cineres’. In South Africa it is called the ‘Kalahari Christmas tree’, and because of the attractive 2-coloured hanging flowers some people call it ‘tassels for the chief’s hat’. But most commonly it is known as the ‘sickle bush’, because the young pods are curved like sickles.
Ecology

D. cinerea penetrates clear-cut areas far into the rainforest zone. In Malaysia, it occurs in areas with strong seasonal climate, usually on poor, occasionally clayey soils, in brushwood, thickets, hedges, teak forest and grassland. Forms dense hammocks on lateritic soils in Senegal and Sudan, while in India it occurs in dry deciduous forest. It can be an indicator of overgrazing in low rainfall areas. Usually not frost resistant and tolerance is less on poor soils, but definitely drought resistant. It is fire resistant and does not tolerate waterlogging.  It is a weedy species. For instance in Cuba, the tree is unchecked and forms veritable forests on hill land or in areas on which cane growing has been discontinued. In some parts of central Cuba, there are reports that whole farms have been rendered useless by this foreign weed.

Tree management

It grows at a medium to slow rate, 6-8 cm/year. For fuelwood plantations, dune stabilization, ravine afforestation, or erosion control, the spacing should be 3 x 5 m; for silvopasture, 8 x 8 m. Dense plantings help stabilize gully plugs and check-dams. To get maximum fuel biomass, the plants should be harvested at 10 years. However, if the production objective is only fodder, trees should be coppiced every other year after reaching about 5-6 m in height. The plant has moderately vigorous coppicing ability and can also be pollarded and lopped. A plant in the range of 7-8.5 cm collar diameter is suitable for coppicing, and the whole plant can be harvested 15 cm above ground level. The number of regenerated shoots varies between 5 and 9, of which 2-3 branches attain better growth in height, diameter and biomass.

For soil conservation, the species should not be disturbed in any way. Its prolific root suckers will then provide natural spread for complete ground cover within a few years. Later a fodder harvest can be taken by lopping leaves and pods. In the 6th year, the total aboveground biomass is about 31 kg (dry). Thus an average yield of 3.4 t (1.2 t dry) fodder and 22.8 t (11.1 t dry) firewood may be expected on the 6th year from 1 ha of wasteland. It yields about 1 kg of seed pods/tree.

D. cinerea enroaches rapidly on overgrazed, trampled ground and on old lands where the grass cover has been removed. It is difficult to eradicate as it shoots again from portions of root. In certain situations, mechanical or chemical control measures are the only ways to control the potentially serious weed.
Orthodox seed storage behaviour; little loss in viability during 26 years of hermetic storage at room temperature. Add ash to stored seed to reduce insect damage. Can be stored for up to 10 years at room temperature if kept dry and free from insects. There are 50 500-66 500 seeds/kg.

For instance in Cuba, the tree is unchecked and forms veritable forests on hill land or in areas on which cane growing has been discontinued. In some parts of central Cuba, there are reports that whole farms have been rendered useless by this foreign weed.
Natural regeneration is strongest by root suckers. Within a period of 10 years, an individual of this species can produce 130 new stems in a radius of 15 m by its root suckers. Artificial propagation by transplanting root suckers or by using root cuttings is likewise the easiest and usually most successful method of propagation.

Direct sowing of seed is also possible. The freshly collected ripe seeds take long to germinate (15-20 days), mainly due to a thick seed coat. Scarified seeds give better germination, and a pretreatment of 25 minutes in concentrated sulphuric acid gives optimum germination of 3-7 days for freshly collected seeds. Three-year-old seeds require only a 15-minute pretreatment for optimum germination. Under controlled conditions, more than 75% germination may be expected. As soon as the pods ripen on the tree, they should be collected and the seeds taken out, dried and stored. This way, a reasonable amount of seeds could be saved from insect attack. About 1 million seeds/year are expected from a plant and most of the seeds are viable.
Owing to its strong capacity for natural regeneration, it has high potential for ravine afforestation and other soil conservation purposes on difficult sites.
Erosion control:  The plant is widely used for sand dune stabilization and soil conservation; in India, it is recommended for shallow soils, arid western and subhumid alluvial plains and highly degraded calcareous wastelands.
  Fruit and seeds from D. cinerea are edible.
Cattle, camels and game (giraffe, buffalo, kudu, Lichtenstein’s hartebeest, nyala, impala, klipspringer, red duiker and Damara dik-dik) relish the juicy pods that drop to the ground and even eat the young twigs and leaves. Leaves are highly palatable, rich in protein (11-15% crude protein) and mineral content. Young shoots and pods are also browsed by smaller domestic animals. Pods and seeds do not contain hydrocyanic acid, minimizing the chance of poisoning animals.
Apiculture:  The flowers are a valuable honey source.
The wood is dense, burns slowly with few sparks and emits a non-toxic smoke, making it excellent firewood. It often grows many small trunks, ideal in size for carrying in a headload.
Fibre:  The bark yields a strong fibre used for various applications such as twine. The debarked roots are used for strong plaiting work such as for racks and baskets.
Timber: D. cinerea yields a medium to heavy, durable hardwood with a density of 600-1190 kg/cubic m at 15% mc. Heartwood red or dark purple with darker streaks, sharply differentiated from the yellowish-brown sapwood; grain straight or slightly interlocked; texture rather fine and even. Due to its generally small dimensions, its utilization is limited making such items as walking sticks, handles, spears and tool handles. Fencing posts are durable and termite resistant, easily lasting up to 50 years.
Medicine: The bark is used to treat dysentery, headaches, toothaches, elephantiasis and acts as a vermifuge. Root infusions are taken for leprosy, syphilis coughs, as an anthelmintic, purgative and strong diuretic. Pounded roots and leaves are used to treat epilepsy. The roots are chewed and placed on the sites of snakebites and scorpion stings, and the leaves, which are believed to produce a local anaesthesia, are used for the same purpose and also as a remedy for sore eyes and toothache. Leaves are taken as a diuretic and laxative, and used for gonorrhoea and boils; powder from leaves is used in the massage of fractures. The plant is used as a veterinary medicine in India.
Nitrogen fixing: D. cinerea fixes atmospheric nitrogen.
Ornamental:  The sickle bush can be planted in the garden to show off the beautiful pink and yellow lantern flowers during early summer and the interesting branching pattern during winter. A favourite plant to train as a bonsai.
Thorn branch enclosures prevent livestock from straying at night and protect vegetable gardens, cash crops and fodder- or thatch-grass reserves from livestock. Since it is difficult to control, having an aggressive weedy c
Soil improver:  The leaves, rich in nutrients, are frequently used as a green manure. In the Sahel, particularly along riverbanks, it is said to improve soils.
Intercropping:  Highly compatible with certain improved arid-zone grass and forage species such as Cenchrus ciliaris, Lasiurus sindicus and Stylosanthes hamata, making it well suited to silvoipastoral systems."
Didymopanax morototoni,"Local names:

Didymopanax morototoni is a medium-sized tree 8-30 m in height, with a cylinder-shaped bole that is straight and may reach up to 80 cm in diameter at the base; crown small with ramification only at the apex; branches not numerous; has scars on the leaf peduncles. Bark whitish and has a smooth surface.

Leaves large, compound, digitate, 15-40 cm long, alternate; petiole long, 30-60 cm, with well-developed stipules, inserted obliquely on the stem; 10-11 folioles, with elliptical lance-shaped limb, acuminate, undulate, sinuate on the margin, semi-coriaceous, dark-green on the upper surface, brown-red and heavily pilose underneath.

Flower clusters (panicled umbels) lateral, about 20-60 cm long and broad, with branches grey and finely hairy. Flowers very numerous in numerous small, rounded clusters (umbels) less than 1.3 cm across, on spreading flower stalks 1.6-4.7 mm long. The pentamerous, finely brownish and grey hairy flower about 4.7 mm across has a minute basal tube (hypanthium) less than 1.6 mm long enclosing the inferior ovary and bearing the minute 5-toothed calyx; petals 5, white, pointed, more than 1.6 mm long; stamens 5 and styles 2.

Fruit a fleshy berry, grey and covered with a bloom, about 4-9 mm long and 6-12 mm broad; slightly flattened, with 2 styles at apex. It contains 2 oblong, flat brown seeds 4.7 mm long.
Ecology

Frequently found in the upland forests and in old open woodlands. In Peru, it is common on the savannah margins. It prefers open forests with abundant light. Widespread in the wet forests of tropical America.

Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela
Tree management

At 3 years of age, better growth in height has been obtained at a 3 x 2 m spacing and the larger diameter at a 4 x 4 m spacing. Production of 15-18 cubic m/ha per year in uniform stands can be expected.

D. morototoni demands strong light and is abundant in openings, secondary forests and on roadsides. These locations are susceptible to fire in dry periods, and the species is favoured essentially due to its fire-resistant seeds.
Seed"
Dimocarpus longan,"Local names:
 English (lungan,longan tree,longan,dragon's eye), French (longanier), German (Longanbaum), Spanish (mamoncillo chino,longan)
Dimocarpus longan is handsome, erect, 9-12 m in height and 14 m in width, with rough-barked trunk 76.2 cm thick and long, spreading, slightly drooping, heavily foliaged branches.

Leaves evergreen, alternate, paripinnate, 4-10 opposite leaflets, elliptic, ovate-oblong or lanceolate, blunt-tipped; 10-20 cm long and 3.5-5 cm wide; leathery, wavy, glossy-green on the upper surface, minutely hairy and greyish-green beneath. New growth is wine-colored and showy.

Flowers pale-yellow, 5-6-petalled, hairy-stalked, larger than those of the closely related species, Litchi chinensis (lychee), are borne in upright terminal panicles, male and female mingled.

Fruits, globose in drooping clusters, 1.25-2.5 cm in diameter, with thin, brittle, yellow-brown to light reddish-brown rind, more or less rough (pebbled), the protuberances much less prominent than those of the lychee. The flesh (aril) is mucilaginous, whitish, translucent, somewhat musky, sweet, but not as sweet as that of the lychee and with less ""bouquet"". 

Seed round, jet-black, shining, with a circular white spot at the base, giving it the aspect of an eye.
Ecology

The longan is native to southern China, in the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Schezwan and Fukien, between elevations of 150-450 m. It thrives much better on higher ground than the lychee and endures more frost. It is rarely found growing along the dykes of streams as is the lychee but does especially well on high ground near ponds. The longan appears in these regions more often but it, too, cannot stand heavy frosts. After a long period of cool weather over the 3 winter months, with no frost, longan trees bloom well. Blooming is poor after a warm winter.
Native range
China, India, Myanmar
Tree management

A tree can be converted to a preferred cultivar by cutting it drastically back and veneer-grafting the new shoots. In China, if the longan is raised on the lowlands it is always put on the edges of raised beds. On high ground, the trees are placed in pre-enriched holes on the surface. The trees are fertilized after the fruit harvest and during the blooming season, at which time the proportion of nitrogen is reduced. Fresh, rich soil is added around the base of the trees year after year. The longan needs an adequate supply of water and can even stand brief flooding, but not prolonged drought. Irrigation is necessary in dry periods. 

Pruning of many flower-bearing twigs where 3/4 of the flower spikes in the cluster are removed is essential. Later, the fruit clusters are also thinned, in order to increase the size and quality of the fruits. 

In China, full-grown trees given sufficient room–at least 12 m apart–may yield 180-225 kg in good years. Crops in Florida from trees 6 m tall, have varied from light 22.5-45 kg–to medium–68-113 kg, and heavy–135-225 kg. Rarely such trees may produce 272-317 kg. Larger trees have larger crops but if the trees become too tall harvesting is too difficult, and they should be topped. A serious problem with the longan is its irregular bearing–often one good year followed by 1 or 2 poor years.
Seeds are recalcitrant. They lose viability at 18 % moisture content. There is 70 % survival after 7 weeks storage with anesthetic substances such as moist storage at 8-10 deg C with 100 % relative humidity and with 80 % nitrous oxide + 20 % oxygen, but no viability when water is used; and 67 % germination after 250 days moist storage in moist (20 % moisture content) perlite + 4 % chlorthalonil, at 15 deg C.
The longan is native to southern China, in the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Schezwan and Fukien, between elevations of 150-450 m. It thrives much better on higher ground than the lychee and endures more frost. It is rarely found growing along the dykes of streams as is the lychee but does especially well on high ground near ponds. The longan appears in these regions more often but it, too, cannot stand heavy frosts. After a long period of cool weather over the 3 winter months, with no frost, longan trees bloom well. Blooming is poor after a warm winter.
Most longan trees are grown from seed. After drying in the shade for 4 days, they should be planted without delay, but no more than 2 cm deep, otherwise they may send up more than one sprout. Germination takes place within 7-10 days. The seedlings are transplanted to shaded nursery rows the following spring and set in the field 2-3 years later during winter dormancy. Vegetative propagation is undertaken, by means of inarching, nearly always onto 'Wu Yuan' trees 3-5 years old and 1.5-1.8 m high. The union is made no less than 1.2 m from the ground because it is most convenient. Grafting is uncommon, whip-grafting has given 80% success in Taiwan. Air layering is done frequently. Air-layers bear in 2-3 years after planting.
 Longans are much eaten fresh, out-of-hand, but some have maintained that the fruit is improved by cooking. In China, the majority are canned in syrup or dried. The canned fruits were regularly shipped from Shanghai to the United States in the past. Today, they are exported from Hong Kong and Taiwan. For drying, the fruits are first heated to shrink the flesh and facilitate peeling of the rind. Then the seeds are removed and the flesh dried over a slow fire. The dried product is black, leathery and smoky in flavor and is mainly used to prepare an infusion drunk for refreshment.
The seeds and the rind are burnt for fuel. The wood is not highly valued for fuel.
Timber: While the tree is not often cut for timber, the wood is used for posts, agricultural implements, furniture and construction. The heartwood is red, hard, and takes a fine polish.
Shade or shelter: The longan is cultivated in Bengal and elsewhere as a shade tree.
Medicine: The flesh of the fruit is administered as a stomachic, febrifuge and vermifuge, and is regarded as an antidote for poison. A decoction of the dried flesh is taken as a tonic and treatment for insomnia and neurasthenic neurosis. In both North and South Vietnam, the ""eye"" of the longan seed is pressed against a snakebite in the belief that it will absorb the venom. Leaves and flowers are sold in Chinese herb markets but are not a part of ancient traditional medicine. The leaves contain quercetin and quercitrin. Dried flowers are exported to Malaysia for medicinal purposes. The seeds are administered to counteract heavy sweating and the pulverized kernel, which contains saponin, tannin and fat, serves as a styptic. 
Ornamental: The tree is widely cultivated as an ornamental.
Alcohol: A liqueur is made by macerating the longan flesh in alcohol."

Diospyros kaki,"Local names:
 English (persimmon,oriental persimmon,keg fig,kaki plum tree,Chinese fig,Chinese plum,Japanese persimmon,date plum), French (kaki,Plaqueminier kaki), German (Kakipflaumenbaum), Italian (cachi), Japanese (kaki), Spanish (kaki del Japon,caqui,kaki)
Diospyros kaki is a multi-stemmed or sometimes single-stemmed deciduous tree up to 6(-18) m tall and typically round-topped, fairly open, erect or semi-erect, sometimes crooked or willowy; seldom with a spread of more than 4.5-6 m. Branches somewhat brittle and can be damaged in high winds.

Leaves alternate, entire, ovate-elliptic, oblong-ovate, or obovate, 7.5-25 cm long, 5-10 cm wide, leathery, glossy on the upper surface, brown-silky beneath; bluish-green, turning in the fall to rich yellow, orange or red; petioles 2 cm long, brown-hairy.

Flowers inconspicuous surrounded by a green calyx tube, borne in leaf axils of new growth from one-year old wood. Female flowers solitary, cream-colored; male flowers pink-tinged, borne in threes. Commonly, 1-5 flowers per twig emerge as the new growth extends. 

Fruit round, conical, oblate, or nearly square, capped by the persistent calyx, skin thin, smooth, glossy, yellow, orange, red or brownish-red; flesh yellow, orange, or dark-brown, juicy, gelatinous, seedless or containing 4-8 seeds. Generally, the flesh is bitter and astringent until fully ripe, when it becomes soft, sweet and pleasant, but dark-fleshed types may be non-astringent, crisp, sweet and edible even before full ripening.

Seed flat, oblong, brown, 2 cm long.

From the Greek diospyros, composed of dios (divine), and pyros (grain), from the edible fruit of some species. The specific epithet is derived from the Japanese word for plant, kaki-no-ki.
Ecology

D. kaki needs a subtropical to mild-temperate climate. It may not fruit in tropical lowlands. In Brazil, the tree is considered suitable for all zones favourable to Citrus, but those zones with the coldest winters induce the highest yields. The atmosphere may range from semi-arid to one of high humidity.
Native range
China, India, Japan, Myanmar
Tree management

The soil should be well prepared–deeply plowed and enriched with organic matter. Trees should be set out at spacing ranging from 4.5 x l.5 m to 6 x 6 m, depending on the habit of the cultivar. In Japan, 1 000 plants/ha may be planted at the outset, and thinned down to 200 trees/ha in 10-15 years.

Good results have been obtained with a fertilizer mixture of 4-6% N, 8-10% P and 3-6% K at the rate of 0.45 kg/tree per year of age. Over-fertilization or excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer causes shedding of fruits.

Young trees are pruned back to 0.7-0.9 m when planted and later the new shoots are thinned with a view to forming a well-shaped tree. Annual pruning during the first 4-5 winters is desirable in some cultivars. If a tree tends to overbear and shows signs of decline, it should be drastically cut back to give it a fresh start. After flowering, the trees should be irrigated every 3 weeks on light soil, every month on heavier soil, until time for harvest. The annual yield of a young tree ranges from 22.6-40.8 kg; of a full-grown tree, 150-250 kg.
Stratification is recommended for all persimmon seeds.

In Brazil, the tree is considered suitable for all zones favourable to Citrus, but those zones with the coldest winters induce the highest yields. The atmosphere may range from semi-arid to one of high humidity.
Propagation is by seed, root suckers or grafting onto wild rootstocks. Seeds for the production of rootstocks need no pretreatment. They are planted in seedbeds or directly in the nursery 20-30 cm apart and 0.9-1.06 m between the rows. After a season of growth, they may be whip-grafted close to the surface of the soil, using freshly cut scions or scions from dormant trees kept moist in sphagnum moss.

Cleft grafting is preferred on larger stock and for top-working old trees. In India, cleft-grafting on stem has been 88.9% successful, low germination rates of planted seeds has been traced to dry rot caused by Penicillium sp. It can be controlled by pretreatment with an appropriate fungicide.
Poison:  Juice of small, inedible wild fruits, crushed whole, calyx, seeds and all, is diluted with water and painted on paper or cloth as an insect- and moisture-repellent.
  Fully ripe fruits are usually eaten out-of-hand. The flesh may be added to salads, blended with ice cream mix or yoghurt, used in pastries, puddings, mousse, or made into jam or marmalade. Ripe fruits can be frozen whole or pulped. Drying is commonly practiced. Roasted seeds have served as a coffee substitute. Tea can also be made from fresh or dried leaves. Kaki is high in vitamin and a moderate source of ascorbic acid.
Timber:  Wood fairly hard and heavy, black with streaks of orange-yellow, salmon, brown or grey; close-grained; takes a smooth finish and is prized in Japan for fancy inlays, though it has an unpleasant odor.
Tannin or dyestuff: Tannin from unripe fruits has been employed in brewing sake, also in dyeing and as a wood preservative. 
Medicine: A decoction of the calyx and fruit stem is sometimes taken to relieve hiccups, coughs and labored respiration.
Ornamental:  It is a handsome ornamental with drooping leaves and branches that give it a languid, rather tropical appearance.
Trees can be planted as a hedge or as a screen if pruned heavily.
Alcohol:  Fruit may be converted into molasses, cider, beer and wine."
Diospyros melanoxylon,"Local names:
 Bengali (kendu,kend), English (coromandel ebony persimmon,ebony), Gujarati (tamrug,tamru), Hindi (abnus,tendu,nallatumki,timburni,kendu,karundumbi), Nepali (abnush,tendu), Sanskrit (dirghapatraka), Tamil (karai,tumbi,tumki,thumbi,karundumbi), Trade name
Diospyros melanoxylon is a medium-sized tree or shrub up to 25 m, and 1.9 m girth. The bark is pelican in colour, exfoliating in rectangular scales. The primary root is long, thick and fleshy at first, afterwards woody, greyish, often swollen in upper part near ground level. The roots form vertical loops in sucker-generated plants.

Leaves opposite or alternate and coriaceus, up to 35 cm long, tomentose on both sides when young, becoming glabrous above when fully grown.

Male flowers are mauve in colour, tetramerous to sextamerous, 1-1.5 cm long, sessile or nearly sessile in short peduncles, mostly 3-flowered. Female flowers mauve, mostly extra-axillary or sometimes solitary, axillary generally 2, opposite each other, larger than the male flowers.

Fruits olive green, ovoid or globose 3-4 cm across; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 8-seeded berries. Pulp yellow, soft and sweet. Seeds compressed, oblong, shiny, often banded.

The generic name is derived from the Greek ‘dios’ (divine), and ‘pyros’ (fruit), referring to the excellent fruit of the genus. The specific name is Greek and means ‘dark wood’.
Ecology

D. melanoxylon demands light; it is drought and frost hardy but sensitive to waterlogging. It is normally found in a dry deciduous forest as a constituent species of Tectona grandis, sal and mixed forests of Acacia leucophlea, Boswellia serrata, Butea monosperma, Lannea coromandelica and Terminalia tomentosa.
Native range
India, Nepal, Pakistan
Tree management

The tree is usually kept reserved and is not felled except in clear-felling coupes, as in the coppice-with-reserves working cycle in India. The main source of production of bidi leaves is from the bushes arising from the root suckers; leaves of bigger trees are stiff and brittle and therefore not capable of producing trade leaves for wrapping bidis. The seedlings are normally planted at 2 m by 2 m. Where the objective of management is the production of leaves, heavy pruning is recommended as this promotes vegetative growth and the production of relatively large and thin leaves, although repeated pruning can cause stunted growth of trees. Plants up to 15 cm in girth are cut near the ground to encourage sprouting of coppice shoots, which gives best quality leaves after 40-50 days of operation. Coppicing experiments in India show that best quality of trade leaves are obtained by coppicing flush to the ground level twice, 2 weeks apart, then coppicing flush to the ground only once.

The tree also pollards well, although the growth of the pollard shoots is slow. Pollarding is done to obtain a good flush of tender leaves, and plants over 15 cm girth are usually cut at 60-90 cm height. The quality of the leaves also depends on whether the frequency and intensity of pollarding impairs the vitality and growth of the trees.

Management for small timber, poles or firewood requires a coppice rotation of about 30 years to give usable products. For ebony wood, a much longer rotation would be needed to give sufficient dimensions to the valuable heartwood.
Orthodox seed storage behaviour; viability maintained for 1 year in open storage; viability lost within 1 year in hermetic storage at room temperature with 11-15% mc. About 5 kg of ripe fruit yields 1 kg of seeds, weighing 1100-2 000 seeds/kg.
D. melanoxylon demands light; it is drought and frost hardy but sensitive to waterlogging. It is normally found in a dry deciduous forest as a constituent species of Tectona grandis, sal and mixed forests of Acacia leucophlea, Boswellia serrata, Butea monosperma, Lannea coromandelica and Terminalia tomentosa.
Natural regeneration is through seedlings, coppice and root suckers. Artificial propagation is through either direct seeding or planting nursery-raised seedlings. Soaking seeds for about 12 hours in cold water improves germination. Stump planting has been found to be as good as direct seeding.
  The fruits and powdered seeds are sold in local markets and eaten.
A tolerance to pruning makes D. melanoxylon a good fodder species. The leaves are reported to contain 7.12% crude protein, and 25.28% crude fibre.
D. melanoxylon is reported to be good fuelwood; calorific value of sapwood is 4957 kcal/kg and of heartwood, 5030 kcal/kg.
Timber:  Wood is hard, whitish-pink, tough, fairly durable and used for building, shoulder poles, mine props and shafts of carriages. The ebony is very heavy and valued for carving and other ornamental works. 
Medicine:  The seeds can be intoxicating; they have been prescribed in India as a cure for mental disorders, nervous breakdowns and palpitations of the heart. The fruits have a cooling and an astringent effect. Dried flowers are reportedly useful in urinary, skin and blood diseases. The bark is astringent; its decoction is used in diarrhoea.
Intercropping:  The results of regular cultivation of D. melanoxylon mixed with agricultural crops is not known. Its cultivation on field boundaries or distributed in field crops, such as oilseed and cereal crops, appears to be a feasible and attractive proposition. Its deep tap-rooting habit would minimize competition with annual crops. Planting may be done in rows that are about 10 m apart with plants about 3 m apart in rows.
Other services: D. melanoxylon leaves possess unrivaled qualities of flavour, colour, flexible and leathery texture, decay resistance and easy workability, which make them admirably suitable for wrapping bidis."
Diospyros mespiliformis,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (jakkalsbessie), Amharic (ayeh), Arabic (jughan,abu seleba,gugham,gughan,abu sebela,jokhan), Bemba (muchenja), English (jackal-berry,swamp ebony,African ebony,ebony diospyros,West African ebony), Lozi (mutomwa,mupako,muchenje), Lunda (mutomwa),
Diospyros mespiliformis is a tall, evergreen tree 15-50 m high, with dense, rounded and buttressed stem. Bark grey-black or black, smooth in young trees rough with small regular scales in older trees, pinkish when slashed. Young branchlets are green, tomentellous with pinkish-white hairs, glabrescent later. Crown is very branchy with dense foliage.

Leaves alternate, shiny-green above, paler beneath, 4-7 cm long, 1.5-5.5 cm wide, oblong elliptic or oblolanceolate-elliptic, rarely lanceolate-elliptic, pubescent when young later becoming glabrescent or with few persistent, appressed hairs beneath, acute or subacuminate at the apex, cuneate or rounded at base with impressed midrib above, prominent beneath.
Flowers pentamerous, white and fragrant. Male flowers sessile hairy and clustered on axillary peduncles. Female flowers solitary, shortly pedicellate and axillary with a 5-lobed calyx.

Fruits usually globose, fleshy, up to 3 cm in diameter, greenish and pubescent when young, yellowish to orange yellow and glabrous when ripe, bell shaped, with persistent style and enlarged calyx and contain 4-6 seeds. Seeds, dark brown, bean-shaped shiny and glabrous.

The generic name Diospyros means ‘divine pear’, and the specific name mespiliformis is derived from two words,‘mesos’ meaning half, and ‘pilos’, which is bullets.
Ecology

The species occurs in woodlands, savannahs and along riverbanks. It prefers areas with permanent water that helps in natural regeneration, and it grows faster in frost-free areas. D. mespiliformis occurs naturally from Ethiopia in the north to Swaziland in the south. It favours heavy soils on riverbanks but also occurs in open woodland and is commonly found on termite mounds. This is a protected tree in South Africa.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Republic of, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Slashing and weeding should be practiced until the trees are well established. Protection from fires helps improve crop stocking in natural forests, and trees should be sheltered in cold areas. The tree can be coppiced.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability can be maintained for one season in open storage, but can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg C with 5-6% mc. On average there are 2 400-3 200 seeds/kg. Under ideal conditions seeds germinate within 50 days.

This is a protected tree in South Africa.
Natural regeneration from seeds, coppice and root suckers. Seeds are soaked overnight in hot water to break dormancy before sowing. They should be sown during spring in flat seed trays filled with river sand. Seedlings are then planted out when they reach the 3-leaf stage because if left longer, the taproot may be damaged when transplanting. They are rather slow growing initially but the growth rate speeds up considerably after a year.
  The edible fruit is used fresh in fermented drink or dried and stored for later use. It can also be made into a type of porridge or more commonly mixed in with mealie meal.
Leaves are eaten by elephant, giraffe, black rhino, eland and kudu, while fruits are eaten by kudu, klipspringer, warthog, baboons, vervet monkeys, yellow spotted rock dassies, pigeons, parrots, hornbills, louries and bulbuls; a definite asset to any farm.
Apiculture:  It provides very good bee forage.
D. mespiliformis makes good fuelwood and charcoal.
Timber:  Wood with a light coloured sapwood, and a dark brown, fine grained, hard and heavy (air-dry 850 kg/cubic m) heartwood. It is hard, strong, fungi and termite resistant and is used for construction purposes, furniture, carvings, floors, stamping blocks, pestles and walking sticks. Dugout canoes are made from this wood especially in Botswana and Namibia.
Medicine:  The leaves, roots, bark and fruits contain antibiotic qualities and have many medicinal uses in West Africa. Roots and bark are used to stop purging and to enhance fertility, while the leaf decoction is used as remedy for fever, otitis and wound dressing. Bark and roots for infections such as malaria, pneumonia, syphilis, leprosy, dermatomycoses, as an anthelmintic and to facilitate child birth. Different parts used against diarrhoea, headache, toothache and as a psycho-pharmacological drug.
Ornamental:  The large trees have a non-aggressive root system and are suitable for very large gardens and farm gardens."
Ekebergia capensis,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (esseboom,essenhout), Amharic (lol,sombo), Bemba (mwela), English (dog plum,ekebergia,Cape ash), Lozi (munyonga,mungombayami), Lunda (mupembe), Tongan (mumbafwe), Xhosa (umGwenyezinja), Zulu (uVungu,uManaye,umGwenya-wezinja,umNyamathi,uSimanaye
Ekebergia capensis is an evergreen or semi-deciduous, medium-sized to large tree, 7-20 (max. 35) m tall. Stem swollen at base; may be tall and fluted in forests and much shorter or unfluted in the open; it may also be buttressed. Branching is erect, then spreading and finally drooping, giving a moderately heavy, flattish crown; 2nd year branchlets slender, usually less than 6 mm in diameter, marked by old, circular leaf scars and conspicuously dotted with white lenticels. Bark grey, grey-brown to almost black, often mottled, smooth or rough, sometimes flaking in small circles or squares; slash red with white streaks.

Leaves compound, 10-36 cm long, 8-18 cm broad, with common midrib, sometimes slightly winged, alternate; stalks jointed to the stem and leaving a scar on falling. Leaflets usually in 3-5 pairs, occasionally up to 7, with a terminal leaflet, leathery, opposite, almost stalkless and smooth; may be long and rather narrow, tapering to the point, broadly oval or almost egg-shaped, glossy green; sessile.

Flowers small, greenish-yellow or white, occasionally touched with pink, 5-petalled, borne in panicles that are long, branching heads, in the axils of leaves; male and female on different trees, sweetly scented, produced in loose sprays about 8 cm long. Each panicle consists of 12-70 flowers, making the tree very conspicuous when in full bloom.

Fruits round, resembling small apples, thin skinned, almost spherical, 1-2 cm in diameter, succulent, with a faint onionlike taste, sweet scent, long stalks, turning pink to bright red when mature with a whitish flesh; drying and splitting to release seeds. Seeds white, oval, 2-4 or occasionally only 1.

The generic name, ‘Ekebergia’, is in honour of Captain Carl Gustaf Ekeberg (1716-1784); the specific name, ‘capensis’, means ‘of the Cape’.
Ecology

E. capensis can tolerate slight drought conditions and very light frost but is tender to severe frost. It occurs in a variety of habitats including high-altitude evergreen forests, riverine forests and coastal sandveld; it is an occasional tree of sub-montane and swamp forests; it is rare on anthills in miombo and savannah woodland. It also occurs in scrub, both along the coast and inland, where it may be stunted or gnarled. E. capensis is found in most parts of Zambia except for the northwest corner and most of Luapula Province. Outside Zambia, it extends in a belt down the eastern side of the continent from Ethiopia through Kenya, Tanzania and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to the Cape, South Africa. Trees are found in most of the forests of South Africa from the Cape to Swaziland and the Transvaal, although not plentiful in the Amatola Mountains. It is a threatened species in Uganda and a protected tree in South Africa.

Trees are found in most of the forests of South Africa from the Cape to Swaziland and the Transvaal, although not plentiful in the Amatola Mountains. It is a threatened species in Uganda and a protected tree in South Africa.
Trees are easily propagated from fresh seeds, which do not require pretreatment, but the fleshy part must be removed from the seed. Seeds take 8-9 weeks to germinate. If seeds are collected on the ground beneath the tree, germination is usually 40-50%, but it can be as high as 90% if seeds are collected off the tree. Seeds are sown in flat seedling trays filled with a mixture of river sand and compost (5:2), covered with sand not deeper than 5 mm and kept moist. It is best to out-plant seedlings when they are 100-150 mm tall. Wildings and cuttings can also be used to propagate E. capensis.
Erosion control: E. capensis is employed in soil conservation.
  Although the flesh of the fruit is edible, it is not very palatable.
Domestic stock and game (bushbuck, kudu, nyala) readily browse the fresh and fallen leaves, especially during times of drought. Baboons, vervet and samango monkeys, bushpig, bushbuck and nyala eat the fallen fruit beneath the tree. A useful tree to attract fruit eating birds.
Apiculture:  Trees provide forage for bees.
Firewood and charcoal can be obtained from the trees.
Timber:  The heartwood and sapwood are not clearly defined; wood is susceptible to insect attack, is light (air-dry 592 kg/cubic m), soft, with an even grain, easily worked; straw-coloured to light brown; polishes well, but is not very durable. It must be treated with a 10% solution of zinc chloride to protect against insects. Used for furniture, light construction, poles, tool handles, panelling, beams for boat building, sides of wagons, doors, windows, carving, interior carpentry and broom handles.
Shade or shelter:  Trees are worth cultivating for the useful shade they provide; they also act as windbreaks.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark contains 7.23% tannin and is used for tanning leather.
Medicine:  A decoction of the root is said to relieve headaches and chronic coughs; leaves provide a remedy for intestinal worms. Bark is used as an emetic and to cure dysentery.
Ornamental: As E. capensis has a non-aggressive root system, it is suitable for large gardens and parks; in South Africa, it has been planted as a street tree.
Intercropping:  Trees may be intercropped with coffee and bananas."
Elaeis guineensis,"Local names:
 Burmese (si-htan,si-ohn), Creole (crocro guinee,crocro), Dutch (oliepalm), English (wild oil palm,African oil palm,guinea oil palm,oil palm), French (crocro,corossier,corojo de Guinea,crocro guinée,palmier a huile), German (Steinfrüchte,Ölpalme), Italian
Elaeis guineensis is a handsome tree reaching a height of 20 m or more at maturity. The trunk is characterized by persistent, spirally arranged leaf bases and bears a crown of 20-40 massive leaves. The root system consists of primaries and secondaries in the top 140 cm of soil.

Leaves numerous, erect, spreading to drooping, long, reaching 3-5 m in adult trees; leaf stalks short with a broad base. Spiny, fibrous projections exist along the leaf margins from the leaf sheath, wearing away on old leaves to jagged spines. Leaf blades have numerous (100-160 pairs), of long leaflets with prominent midribs, tapered to a point; arranged in groups or singly along the midrib, arising sometimes in different planes.

Male and female inflorescences occur on 1 plant; sometimes a single inforescence contains both male and female flowers. Inflorescences arise among the leaf bases in large, very dense clusters, with innumerable small flowers, enclosed in the bud stage in 2 large fibrous bracts, which finally become deciduous. Male flowers single or in pairs in recesses on the branchlets, each with 3 sepals, 3 petals with edges touching in bud, 6 stamens, and a small, sterile pistil. Female flowers subtended by 2-3 small bracts, with 3 sepals, 3 petals overlapping in bud in a ring of small, sterile stamens, and a 3-celled ovary with 3 spreading stigmas.

Fruits borne in bunches. The average weight of each bunch is 23 kg, but a bunch may weigh up to 82 kg. A bunch contains between 200 and 2000 sessile ovoid drupes, 4 cm long and 2 cm broad, with pointed apex. The fruit coat colour varies from yellow to orange or nearly black. Four oil palm varieties have been distinguished on the basis of the fruit structure, especially the thickness of the endocarp: E. g. var. macrocarpa with 40-60% shell, E. guineensis var. dura with 20-40% shell, E. g. var. tenera with 5-20% shell and E. guineensis var. pisifera, a shelless form.

The generic name comes from the Greek word ‘elaion’ (oil), referring to the oil extracted from the palm.
Ecology

It is difficult to determine the natural habitat of the oil palm because, while it does not grow in primeval forest, it flourishes in habitats where forests have been cleared. It requires a relatively open area to grow and reproduce itself and thrives best when soil moisture is maintained. Normally, E. guineensis occurs in disturbed forests and along rivers and streams, both in its native range in West Africa and in some introduced areas. It is a succession species favoured by slash and burn, and its gene pool has expanded as farmers clear land and create more open habitat for the germination of its seeds.
Native range
Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Uganda
Tree management

Initial spacing is normally 9 m in a triangular arrangement, giving 140 trees/ha. The individual trees are fenced with wire netting to protect them from attack by rodents and grass cutters that eat the heart of young palms during the 1st few years. Mulching to conserve moisture in the dry season is necessary. The lower senescent leaves should be removed and burnt.
Seed storage behaviour is intermediate. Storage temperatures of 5 deg. C are said to damage seed viability in moist storage. Kernels were safely dried to 4.4% mc when set to germinate in vitro. However, hermetic storage of intact kernels at -18 deg. C or -196 deg. C with moisture content between 20.9% and 4.4% resulted in a loss in viability by about 13%; no loss in viability after 8 months subsequent storage in liquid nitrogen; no loss in viability occurred after 4 months hermetic storage at either 10 deg. C or 30 deg. C with 19.4-5.2% mc; 50-70% of excised embryos survived desiccation to 10.4% mc by slow drying, and no loss in viability in subsequent cryostorage overnight; seeds tolerated desiccation to 10-6% mc; depending on seed lot, no loss in viability after 12 months of hermetic storage at 15 deg. C, but complete loss in viability occurred at 0 deg. C and -20 deg. C; there are about 230 seeds/kg.
It is difficult to determine the natural habitat of the oil palm because, while it does not grow in primeval forest, it flourishes in habitats where forests have been cleared. It requires a relatively open area to grow and reproduce itself and thrives best when soil moisture is maintained.

It is a succession species favoured by slash and burn, and its gene pool has expanded as farmers clear land and create more open habitat for the germination of its seeds.
E. guineensis is normally seed propagated. As seeds naturally germinate slowly, pretreatment is necessary. The seeds are placed in intact 500-gauge polythene bags arranged on wooden boxes in a germinator at 39-40 deg. C for 75-80 days. They are then soaked in cold water for 3 days, changing water every 24 hours. The seeds are drained and dried under shade and kept at room temperature. They are examined every 2 weeks for germination and drying. Drying seeds are sprayed with water; germinated seeds are picked for potting. This treatment gives an 80% germination rate.
Oil palm is a good crop for rehabilitating degraded areas. In Sumatra it has successfully been established on abandoned farmlands taken over by Imperata cylindrica.
  Palm oil is popular in West Africa and Malaysia for cooking. It is now imported by India to meet local shortages in edible oil, being cheaper than many other vegetable oils. In West Africa, palm oil is often added directly to bring richness to soups and sauces. Addition of oil to cereal preparations greatly increases their calorific density, which is particularly advantageous for young children. Palm oil is also used as frying oil in the preparation of snacks such as bean cakes and fried plantain. Its 10% linoleic acid content makes it an excellent source of carotene. This is important in reducing incidence of vitamin A deficiency and the occurrence of nutritional blindness. Oil palm also provides heart-of-palm.
Pressed cake is used as cattle feed.
Apiculture: The juice from fermenting fruit is collected by bees. The honey is dark amber with an astringent flavour.
It is technically possible to produce from palm oil either carbohydrates for conversion to alcohol or a methanolizable oil as a diesel substitute. In Togo, the pressed fruits are dried and fashioned into cakes for cooking fuel.
Shade or shelter:  E. guineensis shade is lighter than that of other plantation crops such as rubber or cocoa and is suitable for substantial quantities of undergrowth, attracting livestock. Attention has been given to raising livestock in oil palm planta
Lipids:  Palm kernel oil contains about 50% oil. This oil is used in hard water soaps, the manufacture of glycerin, shampoos and candles. The better grades are used in manufacturing margarine.
Ornamental: E. guineensis has been planted as an ornamental on tobacco estates around Deli and Medan in Sumatra.
Soil improver:  The potash-rich residue from boilers is routinely recycled onto plantations to help enrich the soils for instance in Malaysia. Labour and transportation costs may discourage such recycling.
Intercropping:  Coffee and cocoa are small trees that can be planted among E. guineensis trees. Shading with E. guineensis presents certain difficulties, because while cocoa benefits from greater shade when it is young, the shade that the palm provides becomes increasingly undesirable as the cocoa plantation matures.
Alcohol:  Palm wine is the delicious wine obtained by tapping the base of the immature inflorescence of the oil palm. Freshly tapped, undiluted and chilled, palm wine is pleasant to drink and is very high in yeast content. The sale of palm wine is conside"
Emblica officinalis,"Local names:
 Bengali (amla), Burmese (tasha,zibyu), Chinese (ganlanshu,youganzi,yougan,dianganlan), English (emblic myrobalan,malacca tree), Filipino (nelli), French (emblique officinale,groseillier de Ceylan), German (Amalanbaum,Graue Myrobalane,Amblabaum), Hindi (a
Embelica officinalis is a graceful ornamental tree, normally reaching a height of 18 m and, in rare instances, 30 m. Its fairly smooth bark is a pale greyish-brown and peels off in thin flakes like that of the guava. While actually deciduous, shedding its branchlets as well as its leaves, it is seldom entirely bare and is therefore often cited as an evergreen. 

The miniature, oblong leaves, only 3 mm wide and 1.25-2 cm long, distichously disposed on very slender branchlets, give a misleading impression of finely pinnate foliage. 

Small, inconspicuous, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in compact clusters in the axils of the lower leaves. Usually, male flowers occur at the lower end of a growing branchlet, with the female flowers above them, but occasional trees are dioecious. The nearly stemless fruit is round or oblate, indented at the base, and smooth, though 6 to 8 pale lines, sometimes faintly evident as ridges, extending from the base to the apex, giving it the appearance of being divided into segments or lobes.

Light green at first, the fruit becomes whitish or a dull, greenish-yellow, or, more rarely, brick red as it matures. It is hard and unyielding to the touch. The skin is thin, translucent and adherent to the very crisp, juicy, concolorous flesh. Tightly embedded in the center of the flesh is a slightly hexagonal stone containing 6 small seeds. Fruits collected in South Florida vary in the range 2.5-3.2 cm in diameter but choice types in India approach 5 cm in width. Ripe fruits are astringent, extremely acid, and some are distinctly bitter.

The specific epithet is derived from opificina shortened to officina, originally a workshop or shop, later a monastic storeroom, then a herb-store, pharmacy or drug store: it more often refers to the past than the present.
Ecology

The emblic is subtropical rather than strictly tropical. It survives the unusually cold winter weather in its natural habitat and often shows a remarkable ability to recover from cold injury. On the other hand, it is intolerant of excessive heat. In India, mature trees can stand temperatures up to 46º C in the summer but young plants must be shaded.
Native range
Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka
Tree management

It is recommended that the trees be spaced 9-12 m apart and planted in well prepared holes enriched with a composted manure and soil mixture, and well watered. Thereafter, watering is done only in the dry season. Trees usually begin to bear when 5 to 6 years old and normally bear for about 50 years. 
There are no standard practices for fertilizing the emblic but 28-42 g of nitrogen per tree for each year of age up to 10 years has been suggested. After 10 years the nitrogen is increased and potash and superphosphate are added. Half of the fertilizer should be given after fruit-set and the other half 4 months later. 

Emblic trees bearing fruits of inferior quality may be top-worked by cutting back to a height of 1.2 m and applying coal tar to the cut surfaces. Trials at Saharanpur showed that this is best done in March when the trees are not in active growth. Budding of the new shoots can be done successfully any time from June to September. 

The branches are brittle and judicious pruning to develop a strong framework is advocated to avoid branch breakage from heavy loads of fruit.
The seed is extracted by drying the ripe fruits in the sun until they dehisce and the seeds escape. The seed is dried before storage. Seeds weigh 65 000-69 000/kg.  The seed does not store well.

On the other hand, it is intolerant of excessive heat. In India, mature trees can stand temperatures up to 46º C in the summer but young plants must be shaded.
Seeds taken from overripe fruits sun-dried to facilitate removal of the stone, or cut in half right through the stone often propagates the tree. The extracted seeds are given the float test and 100% of those that sink will germinate.
In 4 months, seedlings will have a stem diameter of 8 mm and can be budded or grafted from June to September and in February and March in India. The Forkert and patch techniques have given 85% to 100% success. Chip-budding, using seedlings 1 1/2 years old as rootstocks, is easier and 60% to 80% successful in September and October and February and March. Inarching is sometimes practiced in India but survival rate may be only 25% to 30% after separation from the stock and further losses may occur in the field.
 Rural folk in India claim that eating the highly acid, fresh, raw fruit followed by water, produces a sweet and refreshing aftertaste. Woodcutters in Southeast Asia eat the emblic to avoid thirst, as the fruit stimulates the flow of saliva. This is the one tree left standing when forests are clear-cut in Thailand, and buses stop along highways to let thirsty travelers run to the tree to get the fruits. The emblic is regarded as sacred by many Hindus and the Hindu religion prescribes that ripe fruits be eaten for 40 days after a fast in order to restore health and vitality. It is a common practice in Indian homes to cook the fruits whole with sugar and saffron and give one or two to a child every morning.  Fresh emblics are baked in tarts, added to other foods as seasoning during cooking, and the juice is used to flavor vinegar. Both ripe and half-ripe fruits are candied whole or made into jam and other preserves, sweetmeats, pickles and relishes. They are combined with other fruits in making chutney. In Indonesia, emblics are added to impart acidity to many dishes, often as a substitute for tamarinds.  During World War II, emblic powder, tablets and candies were issued to Indian military personnel as vitamin C rations. In Thailand, where the tree is common in the forests, deer, especially the tiny barking deer, favours the fruits.
Fodder: The foliage furnishes fodder for cattle.
Fuelwood: The wood serves also as fuel and a source of charcoal.
Timber: The hard but flexible red wood, though highly subject to warping and splitting, is used for minor construction, furniture, implements, gunstocks, hookas and ordinary pipes. Durable when submerged and believed to clarify water, it is utilized for crude aqueducts and inner braces for wells, and branches and chips of the wood are thrown into muddy streams for clarification and to impart a pleasant flavour. 
Tannin or dyestuff: The tannin-rich bark, as well as the fruit and leaves, is highly valued and widely employed in conjunction with other so-called myrobalans, especially fruits of various species of Terminalia. The twig bark is particularly esteemed for tanning leather and is often used with leaves of Carissa spinarum and Anogeissus latifolia.  The dried fruit yields ink and hair-dye and, having detergent properties, is sometimes used as a shampoo. Dyes from the fruit and leaves impart an appealing light-brown or yellow-brown hue to silk and wool. When sulfate of iron is added as a mordant, the color becomes black. 
Medicine: The emblic is of great importance in Asiatic medicine, not only as an antiscorbutic, but in the treatment of diverse ailments, especially those associated with the digestive organs. For such use, the fruit juice is prepared in the form of a sherbet or is fermented. In the latter state, it is prescribed in jaundice, dyspepsia and coughs. The dried chips of flesh are dispensed by apothecaries and often are mixed with grape juice and honey for dosage. The fruit is considered diuretic and laxative. Triphala, a decoction of emblic with Terminalia chebula and T. bellerica is given for chronic dysentery, biliousness, hemorrhoids, enlarged liver and other disorders.  A powder prepared from the dried fruit is an effective expectorant as it stimulates the bronchial glands. The juice that exudes when the fruit is scored while still on the tree is valued as eyewash and an application for inflamed eyes. An infusion made by steeping dried fruit overnight in water also serves as eyewash, as does an infusion of the seeds.  Liquor made from the fermented fruits is prescribed as a treatment for indigestion, anaemia, jaundice, some cardiac problems, nasal congestion and retention of urine.  The flowers, considered refrigerant and aperient, and roots, emetic, are also variously employed.  An ointment made from the burnt seeds and oil is applied to skin afflictions. The seeds are used in treating asthma, bronchitis, diabetes and fevers. They contain proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes, phosphatides and a small amount of essential oil. Approximately 16% consist of a brownish-yellow fixed oil. 
Soil improver: The branches are lopped for green manure. They are said to correct excessively alkaline soils.
Essential oil: A fixed oil derived from the fruit allegedly acts as a hair-restorer and is used in shampoos in India. This oil is the main ingredient in an ""Amla Conditioner"" currently sold by Shikai Products of Santa Rosa, California, by mail and through"

Ecology

It occurs in the lowland to lower montane forest, especially in secondary growth, along streams and on hills and slopes together with Balakata baccata (Roxb.) Esser. It is an opportunist species. Its occurrence characterizes former shifting cultivation activities in the Malaysia.
Native range
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand
Tree management

Site preparation: The area should be clear-felled and burnt, which is usually carried out during the dry period. Once the area is prepared, transplanting can be conducted during the rainy season at the end of the year.

Planting: Being a light demanding species, E. malaccense can be planted in open. The method of establishing is through clear-felling and burning area. This operation is usually carried out during the dry period. Once the area is prepared, transplanting can be done to take the advantage of rainy season at the end of the year.

Husbandry: E. malaccense is a pioneer species with a fast growth, which makes it possible to compete with other species. To ensure better competition, closed planting such as 3 x 3 m is suitable eliminating weed problem but also enhancing self-pruning. It regenerates rapidly, is able to self prune and is suitable for coppicing. A mean annual increment of 2.5 cm y-1 in dbh can be attained at age of 13. First thinning of the crop can be carried out about 5 years after planting and the second thinning at 13 to 15 years. The estimated rotation age of is between 18 to 25 years.
The fruit is collected approximately 2-3 months after flowering, once the fruit has turned slightly yellow. In a heavy fruiting season, a 13-year-old tree can produce 2-3 kg of fruits, or 9000-15,000 fresh seeds. Once clean and dry, the seeds may be cold-stored for up to six months. Seed storage behaviour is intermediate. There are about 40,000 seeds per kilogram.
It occurs in the lowland to lower montane forest, especially in secondary growth, along streams and on hills and slopes together with Balakata baccata (Roxb.) Esser. It is an opportunist species. Its occurrence characterizes former shifting cultivation activities in the Malaysia.
E. malaccense can be propagated through direct seeding, cuttings and stumping. It has a low germination rate, due to a high incidence of insect predation of the seeds. E. malaccense seedlings are usually potted 3 months after sowing, and are transplanted in the field approximately 9-12 months after potting.

Wildings are a useful immediate source of planting material for this species. Approximately 2 months after the fruiting season, the ground beneath the mother tree is cleared to enable germination of fallen seeds. The wildings are collected 1-2 months later, and seedlings with 2-4 leaves are suitable for transplanting. During collection, the wildings must be wrapped with moist tissue paper to prevent them from wilting, and may be kept for a maximum of 3 days before replanting in the rooting bed. Wildings are left in the rooting bed for at least 2 weeks before potting, once potted they are kept in the nursery for another 6-9 months before planting out.

Larger wildings can be collected using the stumping method. The stem and root are cut at approximately 5-7 cm above and below the collar region, to produce stumps of 10-14 cm in length. All lateral roots are also severed. Stumps can be kept for 1-2 days under moist conditions before planting in polybags or directly in the ground. For mass production of planting material, cutting can be produced from coppices and young seedlings achieving a good rooting percentage of 80 to 100%.
Sesendok is used in reforestation or may be used in enrichment planting.
Timber:  E. malaccense is a light hardwood timber with an average density of about 400 kg per cubic m at 15% moisture content. The wood is bright yellow and is difficult to differentiate between the sapwood and the heartwood. It is suitable for a wide range of general utility purposes such as for making matchboxes, match splints, drawing boards, black boards and toys. It is a favourite timbers for making clogs, pattern making, trays, furniture parts, plywood chests, low grade coffins, disposable chop-sticks and other small articles. 
Shade or shelter: Sesendok is as a shade tree.
Medicine: The bark is used to treat dropsy and the roots help to heal injuries.
Intercropping: The species is used in agroforestry, such as interplanting with rubber in an alley cropping system. After 25 years, both the rubber and E. diadenum are harvested together. E. diadenum may also be interplanted with short term crops, only for the first three years before the canopy closes above."

Ecology

E. utile is a climax community heliophyte- light demanding species. In Uganda it grows in mixed to climax rain forests. E. utile is primarily a lowland tree species occuring between 0-500 m in West Africa and below 1 400 m in Uganda. It normally occurs with other Entandrophragma spp.
Native range
Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda
Tree management

E. utile is a light demanding species requiring 50-90% of full daylight, however young seedlings require shading until fully established. Once at the sapling stage they demand a great amount of light. The species grows slowly; diameter growth rates of 1.0-1.5 cm per annum can be expected. Seedlings should be protected from browsers.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox, seeds tolerate dessication to 4% moisture content, 92% germinate following 240 days subsequent hermetic storage at 2 deg C. Soaking in water for 12 hours hastens germination. Seeds are hand picked and there are 1 880 seeds/kg. Seed damage by insects can be prevented by adding ash in storage containers.

E. utile is propagated largely from seedlings and wildings, rarely raised by direct seeding. Planting of 3-4 month old E. utile seedlings in polythene bags, although reliable, involves subsequent difficulties in tending because of the small size of the stock. The seedlings develop a long taproot and if potted should be transplanted early to prevent root coiling at the pot or polythene bag base. In nurseries the seeds are sown in pots or seed beds, and the young plants raised in the nursery for 1-2 years; during this time the roots must be cut back several times. Planting stock should be at least 50 cm tall before outplanting. Good results are achieved with seedlings whose roots have been pruned to the size of the planting hole (40 x 40 x 40 cm) and with striplings. Planting of stumps is not practical.
E. utile is used in afforestation in Cote d’Ivoire.
Erosion control:  Important in protecting soil from erosive activities of water.
Leaves browsed by animals.
E. utile is an excellent source of fuel wood and charcoal.
Timber:  Produces an excellent timber, specific gravity about 0.54-0.75 g/cu cm, similar to that of mahogany (Khaya spp.), reddish in colour and fine grained, with multiple uses in high class joinery and furniture, canoes, railway coachwork, plywood manufacture and decorative veneer. The wood seasons well and is easy to work. Its natural durability is good, it glues well, has good strength attributes for fastening with nails and screws, and can be easily processed. Large quantities, of ready or part sawn timber are exported to Europe. Wood drying was significantly affected by temperature but little affected by pressure, high pressure causes excessive thickness shrinkage. Drying defects were considerably reduced by starting with a temperature of 120 deg C and increasing it by 10 deg C steps to a final value of 150 deg C at a constant pressure of 15 Kp/sq cm (Okoh 1984). 
Shade or shelter:  Mufumbi is an ideal shade tree.
Medicine:  The bark of this tree is used in Cameroon to treat malaria and bark extracts have displayed fungicidal activity against Pyricularia oryzae. This plant is traditionally used in Nigerian medicine, and is claimed to achieve complete healing of peptic ulcers in humans. Tests in mice and rats supported these claims at least in part."

Enterolobium cyclocarpum is one of the largest trees in the dry forest formation, reaching up to 40 m in height and 3 m in diameter, with a huge, spreading crown. Older E. cyclocarpum trees develop small buttresses and produce large roots that run along the surface of the ground for 2-3 m. Sidewalks, roads, or foundations may be cracked or raised by E. cyclocarpum trees growing close by.

The bipinnate compound leaves of E. cyclocarpum have 5 opposite leaflets.

The small white flowers occur in compact, round heads.

Seeds contained in distinctive, thickened, contorted, indehiscent pods that resemble an ear in form; seed 20 x 15 mm, ovate, compressed, dull, reddish-brown, with 100% pleurogram, marked with a yellowish band on each face, punctiform apical hilium concealed or not by whitish funicle; adult trees produce about 2000 pods, each with 10-16 seeds.
Ecology

Colonizing a wide range of habitats, E. cyclocarpum is a climax species in subtropical, dry forest zones, restricted to disturbed areas in wetter forest types. It is a dominant species in all the tree associations in which it is found. In Mexico, it is found in association with Ficus mexicana, Sideroxylon capirit, Trichilia hirta, Ceiba pentandra, and others. Dry seasons of 1-6 months are usual in most of its habitats.
Native range
Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Mexico, United States of America, Venezuela
Tree management

Spacing of 4 x 4 m with thinning on a rotation of 25-35 years is recommended. E. cyclocarpum is shade intolerant. The tree must receive adequate sunlight as a dominant or codominant from the sapling stage onwards. Careful weeding of the plantation is essential during the early years. Pruning can improve the length and form of the bole. It resprouts vigorously after coppicing or lopping. Little information is available, however, on its response to repeated cutting.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seeds tolerate desiccation to 10.7% mc. Seeds remain viable for several years under cool, dry conditions and can be easily stored under normal conditions. There are 900-1200 seeds/kg.

Collected seeds require pretreatment before sowing to allow water to penetrate the seed coat. Manual scarification is effective, as is treatment with hot water or concentrated sulphuric acid. E. cyclocarpum trees coppice, and even large trees sometimes sprout when cut. There has been no report on grafting or rooting of cuttings.

Natural regeneration is infrequent for several reasons. The seeds are spread principally by grazing animals, and after germination are always browsed off. They are also susceptible to fire, excessive shade, drought and competition from grasses.
  Immature pods are cooked as a vegetable, or the seeds are toasted and ground.
Large quantities of highly palatable and nutritious pods containing a sugary pulp are produced by the tree, and are consumed readily by livestock. The foliage is also palatable, though to a lesser extent than the pods.
Fibre:  The wood of E. cyclocarpum has been found excellent for producing quality paper.
Timber:  E. cyclocarpum heartwood is reddish-brown, coarse-textured and moderately durable. The wood is resistant to attack by dry-wood termites and Lyctus, and can be used in house construction as well as in interior elements, including panelling. The white sapwood is susceptible to insect attack. The wood may also be used for boat building, because of its durability in water.
Shade or shelter:  The wide-spreading canopy of E. cyclocarpum makes it an ideal shade tree for livestock in pasturelands and perennial crops such as coffee.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Tannin from the pods and bark is used in soap making.
Medicine:  Bark extracts are used medicinally against colds and bronchitis.
Nitrogen fixing:  E. cyclocarpum is a nitrogen-fixing species.
Ornamental:  A popular tree for roadsides and urban planting.
Intercropping:  The ability of E. cyclocarpum to fix nitrogen and to sprout vigorously when coppiced point to its possible role as a hedgerow species in alley-cropping systems."
Eriobotrya japonica,"Local names:
 Amharic (woshmella), Cantonese (luküh,lukwat,pi-pa), Chinese (luju,biba), Creole (lokwat), English (loquat,Japan-plum,Japanese medlar,Japanese loquat,green loquat,stinking toe), French (bibassier du Japon,bibace,néflier du Japon), German (Loquate,japanis
Eriobotrya japonica is an evergreen shrub or small tree 6-8 m high; bole usually rather short, 0.6-1 m long, surmounted by a dense, ovoid or globular crown; bark grey and shallowly fissured, on young branches it is pale brown and hairy. 

Leaves are somewhat crowded towards the end of the stout, woolly branchlets, large, alternate, subsessile, stiff, coriaceous, elliptic, lanceolate to obovate, lanceolate in outline, 21-32 cm in length, with remotely toothed to sharply dentate margins; dark, glossy, green above and rusty-tomentose below; base green, obtuse or narrowed into a very short, stout, woolly, stipulate petiole. 

Flowers fragrant, 1.2 cm broad, borne in woolly panicles, 10-20 cm long; calyx composed of 5 small, imbricate, acute teeth; corolla has 5 oblong, ovate-clawed petals, white in colour and delicate in texture; stamens 20; pistils 5, joined towards the base. 

Fruits borne in clusters, commonly round, oval or pyriform, 2.5-8 cm in length, pale yellow to orange, somewhat downy on the surface; skin about as thick as that of a peach, but slightly tougher; flesh firm and fleshy in some varieties, melting in others, the colour ranging from almost white to deep orange, juicy and with subacid flavour; seeds 4-10, brownish, oblong, 1-2 cm long.

Many E. japonica cultivars exist. Based on origin, 2 groups are distinguished: the Chinese groups with large, pyriform, deep orange fruit, ripening mid-season to late, which can be kept for 1-2 weeks, and the Japanese group with small, slender, light-coloured fruit, maturing early and having a shorter shelf life.

The generic name is derived from the Greek words ‘erion’ (wool) and ‘botrys’ (cluster), from the woolly appearance of the spiked inflorescence; the specific epithet means 'of Japan'.
Ecology

Originally from regions with a subtropical climate, E. japonica requires a mild climate with rainfall evenly spread throughout the year, without excessive heat, especially during fruit ripening. The most favourable conditions for productivity and quality are to be found near the sea. Once established, it is tolerant of drought and of slight frost. Temperatures lower than -5 deg. C damage the flowers, and those lower than -12 deg. C are fatal.
Native range
China, Japan
Tree management

E. japonica is a productive and regular bearer. Barring crop failure resulting from severe frosts at flowering time, the trees rarely fail to produce well every year. Their tendency is to overbear, with the result that the fruits are apt to be undersized. It has been profitable to thin the crop, since the increased size of the fruits remaining on the tree more than compensates for the fruits removed. 

Planting spacing is either 3.5 x 7 m or 6 x 6 m. For good productivity, manuring and inter-planting with a nitrogen-fixing leguminous crop are recommended. Manuring should be carried out every 2 years at the rate of 40-50 kg/tree, or 12-40 t/ha. After planting out, the trees are pruned 60-75 m above the ground level to promote the growth of 3-5 branches. They are also pruned immediately after harvesting to limit the number of fruits and even out production. Grafted trees, when available, remain smaller but make stronger growth and produce fruit faster. Where insolation is strong the fruit clusters are bagged to prevent sunburn. On the other hand, the fruit is sour without sunshine, as occurs in northern Tanzania.
The seed does not store well and should be sown when still fresh. Moist storage is recommended; 92% germination following 6 months moist storage at 5 deg. C; viability maintained for 8 days in moist storage at 5 deg. C. Seed storage behaviour of E. japonica has been provisionally classified as recalcitrant, since only moist storage has been recommended. But this does not necessarily mean that this species shows recalcitrant seed behaviour. There are about 600 seeds/kg.

C damage the flowers, and those lower than -12 deg. C are fatal.
E. japonica is propagated by seed, air-layering, T-budding, or side grafting. Propagation is generally by direct sowing of seed, as pretreatment is not necessary for germination. In many countries it is still the custom to propagate the E. japonica by seed, but in regions where commercial cultivation of this fruit has received serious attention, budding and grafting have replaced this method. Seedlings or stools are placed in 10 cm pots; when they reach a diameter of about 1 cm, they are budded or grafted (the eye with a strip of bark is taken from young wood that has lost its pubescence and leaves). Immediately after planting out, the plants are cut down to 5-10 cm above the graft. There are numerous varieties that vary greatly in the form of the fruit and in productivity.
Poison:  The seeds are poisonous and should be removed before cooking the fruit. The flowers are used as an insect repellent. 
  The fruit has a thick, tough peel surrounding the firm flesh, with a flavour reminiscent of a peach. It is rich in pro-vitamin A, having a very high carotene content. E. japonica is usually eaten fresh but may be stewed, served as a sauce, syrup or jam, or made into an excellent jelly. The fruit composition is 84-89% water, 0.32-0.35 % protein, 0.3-0.6% lipids, 9.89-12.79% sugar and starch, 0.3-0.37% cellulose, and 0.29-0.26% ash. The fruits are a good source of acid and pectin. The seeds, which have an almondlike taste, are used to flavour drinks and cakes.
Tender branches are used as fodder in India and in East Africa.
Apiculture:  Bees are easily attracted to the fragrant, white flowers. Honey is amber coloured with an agreeable flavour.
The wood of E. japonica has market value as firewood.
Timber:  E. japonica has a medium-weight to heavy heartwood with a density of 655-950 kg/cubic m at 15% mc. The heartwood is pale purple-brown with darker streaks, not clearly differentiated from the sapwood. The grain is straight with an attractive silvery look, and the texture is fine and even. The wood is occasionally slightly fragrant. The wood has very little tendency to split or check, is hard, and takes a good polish. It is suitable for poles and posts, carving and drawing materials such as rulers, and is in demand for making stringed musical instruments. 
Shade or shelter:  The fairly dense crown and a compact trunk make E. japonica useful for shade and as a windbreak.
Medicine:  The fruits are considered a sedative and are used in allaying vomiting and thirst. The tanniferous leaves are astringent and antidiarrhoetic, and in China are used to treat wounds. The flowers are used as an expectorant and, extracted in oil, in cosmetics.
Ornamental:  Because of its ornamental appearance alone, E. japonica is often planted in parks and gardens. It is also grown as an indoor pot plant.
In the Kilimanjaro region of East Africa, the tree is commonly grown on the borders of home compounds.
Soil improver:  The large leaves of E. japonica trees are suitable for mulch.
Alcohol:  The fruit juice of E. japonica can be used to prepare an alcoholic drink."
Erythrina abyssinica,"Local names:
 Amharic (kuara,korch,korra), Arabic (dus), Bemba (mulunguti), English (Uganda coral,red-hot-poker tree,erythrina,flame tree,lucky bean tree,kaffir boom), Luganda (kiyirikiti,muirikiti,jirikiti,muyirikiti), Lunda (chisunga), Nyanja (mwale,mulunguti), Shon
Erythrina abyssinica is medium-sized tree, usually 5-15 m in height, deciduous, thickset, with a well-branched, rounded, spreading crown; trunk short; bark yellow-buff when fresh, otherwise grey-brown to creamy brown, deeply grooved, thickly corky and often spiny; when damaged the tree exudes a brown, gummy sap.

Leaves compound, trifoliolate, alternate; leaflets almost as broad as long, 5.5-15 x 6-14 cm, with the terminal leaflet the largest; lateral leaflets rather smaller than this, if 3 lobed then obscurely so, densely woolly when young, losing most of these hairs by maturity; midrib and main veins on the undersurface often bear scattered prickles.

Flowers spectacular, in strong, sturdy racemes on the ends of branchlets, orange-red, up to 5 cm long; calyx joined to form a tube, split along the under surface almost to the base and separating away into long, slender, distinctive lobes at the apex; calyx and standard petal striking scarlet to brick red.

Fruit a cylindrical, woody pod, 4-16 cm long, deeply constricted between the seeds, densely furry, light brown in colour, opening to set free 1-10 shiny, red seeds with a grey-black patch.

This species closely resembles E. latissima.  

Erythrina comes from the Greek word ‘erythros’-red, alluding to the showy red flowers of the Erythrina species.  The specific name means ‘from Ethiopia’.
Ecology

E. abyssinica is the most widespread species in Africa, found in savannahs throughout eastern and southern Africa. As with many trees in areas with frequent fires, the young trees establish a deep root system before stem growth. E. abyssinica grows well in most climates but not in dry or high areas. It does not grow in forests.
Native range
Botswana, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Young trees should be protected from heavy frosts until they are well established. Growth is slow. Pollarding and coppicing are suitable for E. abyssinica. Trees should not be pruned until they are 1 year old. Frequent pruning will reduce the competitive effects of hedgerows and increase the ratio of leaves to stems but will also increase labour costs and reduce total tree biomass production. With its soft wood, E. abyssinica is somewhat easier to prune than other species used in alley farming. It may be advisable to grow the trees with shade-tolerant crops, rather than imposing a severe pruning regime to favour shade-intolerant crops. As a shade tree, it can be established rapidly by planting large stakes, 2.5 m long and 8-10 cm in diameter. Stakes this size can produce a canopy of 3-4 m diameter in 6 months.
The seeds may be stored for long periods without losing viability if kept cool, dry and insect free. Seeds that have been damaged by insects should be discarded. Before storage, remnants of the pod should be removed and the seeds sun dried for 1 day. Storage should be in a cool, dry place. For long-term storage, seeds are kept in a low-temperature seed-storage facility (approximately 5 deg. C and 30-40 r.h.). On average, there are about 6800 seeds/kg.

As with many trees in areas with frequent fires, the young trees establish a deep root system before stem growth. E. abyssinica grows well in most climates but not in dry or high areas. It does not grow in forests.
E. abyssinica grows easily from a truncheon planted at the onset of the rainy season and in 3-4 years will have reached a fair size. Propagation may also be carried out using seeds, seedlings, cuttings or direct sowing. The most common method is by large cuttings stripped of leaves, planted at the beginning of the rains directly in the location desired. E. abyssinica seeds have a hard coat and should be scarified to allow moisture to penetrate the seed, enhancing germination and making it more uniform. Seeds are easily scarified by rubbing with sandpaper or nicking with a knife. They should be immersed in water for several hours after scarification until they begin to swell. An alternative pretreatment method is to soak the seed in warm water (40 deg. C) for 12 hours. Seeds should be inoculated with Rhizobium bacteria after pretreatment and immediately before planting. This ensures nodulation and increases nitrogen fixation. Seeds germinate best in sterile sand; the soil can be sterilized by washing it in a solution of 5% formalin in water. The seeds should be well separated from one another in the germination box. Alternatively they may be sown directly into black polythene bags, using a mixture of soil, sand and compost in the proportion of 2:1:1. They should be sown just below the soil surface, with the hilum facing downwards. Nursery-grown plants are ready for transplanting when 20-30 cm tall. They can be established either by planting directly from plastic bags or by removing from the nursery beds and planting as bare-root stock. In the latter case, all leaves should be removed before planting.
Poison:  Seeds of E. abyssinica contain a curare-like poison that, if injected into the bloodstream, acts as an anaesthetic that may cause paralysis and even death by respiratory failure.
Erosion control:  The species is used on stream banks and for soil conservation terraces.
The foliage is considered a good protein supplement for ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats) and has been used as a fodder source for rabbits and pigs.
Apiculture:  The tree provides bees with forage.
E. abyssinica trees may be cut for firewood.
Timber:  The termite-resistant wood E. abyssinica is soft, greyish-white, non-durable, susceptible to fungal attack, and with a shot-silk effect. Although it is somewhat woolly to work, it does not split when nailed but has poor nail-holding ability. It has been used to make stools, toys, drums, utensils, mortars, beehives, pestles, boxes, picture frames, floors, shoes and for construction.
Shade or shelter:  E. abyssinica is grown as a shade plant in coffee plantations and grazing fields.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark and roots yield useful dyes.
Medicine:  Pounded parts are used in a steam form in Kenya to treat diseases such as anthrax, and the bark is boiled with goat meat for treating gonorrhoea. The bark of the green stem may also be pounded and then tied into a fine piece of cloth and the liquid from it squeezed into the eyes to cure inflammation of the lids. The bark may be roasted until black, powdered, and applied to burns and general body swellings. A decoction is taken orally as an anthelmintic and to relive abdominal pains. The roots are used to treat syphilis, and the leaves to cure skin diseases in cattle.
Nitrogen fixing:  The roots of trees are infected by Rhizobia nodulate and fix atmospheric nitrogen.
Ornamental:  The tree is a popular ornamental in the tropics and subtropics.
E. abyssinica has the useful characteristic of sprouting from truncheons if cut just before flowering, and so can be used to make a live fence.
Soil improver:  Leaf fall in the dry season is a source of mulch.
Intercropping:  E. abyssinica is usually combined with annual crops, especially when it is grown in rotation with coffee or cocoa."
Erythrina berteroana,"Local names:
 English (coral bean), Spanish (poro de cerca,pito,pinñón de España,pernilla de casa,machetico,gallito,elequeme,brucal,amapola de cerca)

Intercropping:  The species is used in alley cropping systems."
Erythrina caffra,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (kuskoraalboom,koraalboom,Cape kafferboom), English (lucky bean,kaffir broom,coral tree,coast erythrina), Xhosa (umSintsi), Zulu (umSintsi)
Erythrina caffra is 9-12 (max. 21) m tall; trunk and branches grey, sometimes set with short, sharp prickles.

Leaves trifoliolate, the terminal leaf being the largest, borne on long stalks, which sometimes have a few, short prickles; leaflets broadly ovate to elliptic, 8-16 x 8-18 cm, lateral leaflets slightly smaller, on short stalks, without hairs or spines; apex tapering; base tapering; base of lateral leaflets asymmetric; margin entire; leaflets resemble those of E. lysistemon and when the tree is not in flower, it is difficult to tell them apart.

The flowers, which are produced before the leaves, are borne in large clusters at the end of the thick stalks. They are orange-scarlet with a tinge of terra cotta or are cream. They have short, broad, standard petals, the lower half of which curves upward to expose the stamens, and these give the flower (botanical racemes) a bewhiskered appearance.

The pods are narrow, cylindrical, dark, up to 6.5 cm long, deeply constricted between the seeds, with the constrictions often long and narrow and without hairs. The pods split to show small, shiny, coral-red seeds, marked on 1 side with a black spot. On weathering, the seeds are inclined to loose their brilliancy to become a rich red-brown.

Erythrina comes from the Greek word ‘eruthros’-red, alluding to the showy red flowers of the Erythrina species and caffra from ‘Kaffaria’ (Eastern Cape, South Africa).
Ecology

E. caffra is a tree of coastal districts. In South Africa it occurs from Port Shepstone to the Humansdorp District, the wild tree seen furthest from the coast being about 53 km inland in Albany District. It appears in the north in the Hlabisa and Lake Sibayi areas in Zululand. It is a tree of the wooded stream banks. It is fairly drought resistant and will stand several degrees of frost. Where frosts are heavy, it may grow but will not flower well.
Native range
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland
Tree management

The tree is fast growing. If used for fencing, it should be pruned once a year during the dry season to promote the production of woody biomass for use as new posts. Two prunings a year are recommended to produce palatable stems and leaves for animal fodder. More frequent pruning results in low biomass production and rapid mortality.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Before seeds are stored they should be sun dried for 1 day after residues of the pod have been removed. They can be stored for several years, retaining a high percentage of viability. Storage should be in tightly closed containers, in a cool, dry place. For long-term storage, seeds should be kept in a low-temperature seed-storage facility (approximately 5 deg. C and 30-40% r.h.), and those damaged by insects and disease should be discarded.

Where frosts are heavy, it may grow but will not flower well.
E. caffra is easy to propagate as it grows from seed, cuttings or truncheons. Vegetative propagation is normally from stakes more than 1.5 m long. These are cut at the end of the dry season or the beginning of the rains. They quickly shoot up, and have been known to flower in less than a year. The seeds should be inoculated with nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria that form nodules in their roots. This is done after pretreatment, immediately before planting. Nursery-grown plants are ready for planting in the field when they are 20-30 cm tall. They can be established either by planting directly from plastic bags or by removing them from nursery beds and planting as bare-root stock. In the latter case, all the leaves should be removed before planting.
Poison:  The seeds are said to be poisonous.
Erosion control:  The trees can be used in soil conservation.
E. caffra becomes increasingly important as a protein supplement (for example the palatable stems) during the dry periods when pasture grasses are scarce and of low nutritive value.
The tree is a good source of firewood.
Timber:   The wood is white or grey blue and is very soft, light and spongy. It is used in making canoes, troughs, floats and fishing nets; when tarred, it makes good roofing shingles.
Nitrogen fixing:  E. caffra fixes atmospheric nitrogen.
Ornamental:  The species is a valuable garden tree in the tropics and subtropics.
The trees are used to make live fences around homes, water sources and crops to protect them from livestock.
Soil improver:  E. caffra trees usually drop their leaves during the dry periods, and these act as a mulch."
Erythrina edulis,"Local names:
 Spanish (sachaporoto,sacha purutu,pashuro,pajuro,guat,chachafruto,basul/balú,basul sachaporoto,basul,balú), Trade name (poroto,chachafruto)
Erythrina edulis is a  leafy tree growing up to 14 m tall with stem diameter up to 37 cm and crown diameter up to 7 m. The stem and branches are covered with stout prickles.

Leaves alternate, trifoliate with long petioles and two nectar-producing glands at the base of each leaflet.

Flower cluster (raceme), supported on a stout stalk, consists of 180-200 short-stalked flowers arranged in threes around the axis. The flowers have a reddish-green calyx and a crimson corolla with an upper petal (standard) and two lateral petals forming the keel. The pistil is surrounded by 10 stamens. The two-petaled flowers face upward, forming a large cup in which nectar gathers.

Fruits hang in bunches of 9 and 18 cylindrical pods. Pod size varies widely, but averages 32 cm long and 3 cm in diameter with six seeds. The seed coat is generally brownish-red but is sometimes yellow or black.

Erythrina comes from the Greek word ‘eruthros’-red, alluding to the showy red flowers of the Erythrina species.
Ecology

E. edulis is a pioneer species that grows best in full sunlight, but trees can tolerate some shade in the early stages of growth. In Colombia, the species occurs from elevations of 1 200-2 600 m, with an optimum range from 1 600-2 200 m. In Peru, E. edulis grows from 900-3 200 m. In the species's native range, annual rainfall varies from 450-1 800 mm and temperatures are between 5-25 deg C. The trees grow well in loose-textured sandy loams and in heavy clay soils but not in strongly acidic soils (pH below 4.5). E. edulis does not tolerate long periods of drought, especially during early stages of establishment and does not tolerate frequent frosts.
Native range
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela
Tree management

E. edulis has a normal life span of 30-40 years, its seedlings grow rapidly (2.5 m in the 1st year) and begin producing fruit in approximately 24-27 months. Cuttings begin producing fruit about 18 months after planting.

For maximum fodder production, the trees can be planted in protein banks at a close spacing (1 x 0.5 m). They are first pruned at 10 months and then at 6- or 4-month intervals. A 2-year-old protein bank can produce up to 80 tons of leaves and tender branches per ha, or the leaves can be dried and ground to produce 6 tons of chicken feed rich in carotene.

In Colombia, live fence posts are established from stakes at 2 m intervals and allowed to grow for 30 months before pruning or attaching barbed wire. Pruned at four-month intervals, leafy branches from 1 km of fencing can provide up to 30 tons of fodder per year; unpruned, the same fence posts can provide up to 85 tons of fruit.
Seed should be removed from pods immediately and stored in paper bags in a cool, dark place. Seeds lose viability quickly and should be planted within 8 days of harvesting. Viability can be extended up to 20 days by dipping seeds in molten paraffin so that a thin layer of paraffin coats the entire seed. Seed size varies widely and there are 60-146 fresh seeds/kg.

The trees grow well in loose-textured sandy loams and in heavy clay soils but not in strongly acidic soils (pH below 4.5). E. edulis does not tolerate long periods of drought, especially during early stages of establishment and does not tolerate frequent frosts.
E. edulis is easily propagated from seed or cuttings, but seedlings tend to root deeper and live longer than cuttings. Larger seeds tend to produce more vigorous seedlings. Seeds should be planted in 1-kg polyethylene bags with the convex side facing upwards and slightly exposed. Germination begins in 5-10 days. Seedlings should be shaded in the nursery and shade partially reduced in the last two weeks before out planting. At 60 days, seedlings may be planted out in holes 30 cm deep. E. edulis can also be direct seeded. Cuttings of 4-6 cm diameter, and usually 1 m in length, should be planted to a depth of 30-50 cm within 3 days of cutting. Cuts should be made with well-sharpened tools to avoid damage that can lead to rotting; the top cut should be at a 45° angle. Sealing the cuts with paraffin, plastic, mud or other material can increase survival rates.
 The seed is a component of many diets and contains 23% protein, 1% fat, 8% crude fiber and 84% moisture. Seeds have a good balance of amino acids and a digestibility of about 50% after cooking. Seeds must be boiled for at least 45 minutes or fried thoroughly before being eaten. As a paste, they provide a nutritious base for tortillas, desserts, pies, soups and food for infants. They are also boiled, sun dried, ground and added to flour. Research indicates that uncooked E. edulis seeds can be toxic if consumed over a long period.
Fodder: The leaves and tender branches can be fed to cattle, goats, horses, pigs, guinea pigs and rabbits. Leaves contain 24% protein, 29% crude fiber (dry weight) and 21% total carbohydrates. They are rich in potassium but low in calcium. Seeds and pods can be fed fresh to cattle and goats, but should be cooked before feeding to pigs, chickens, rabbits or fish. The pods contain 21% protein, 23% crude fiber (dry weight), 24% carbohydrates and 91% moisture. Cooked seed can replace up to 60% of the concentrate fed to chickens and fish.
The tree is used as firewood.
Timber: The wood is used for construction.
Shade or shelter: The trees also provide shade in coffee and cacao plantations.
Medicine: In Colombia, a soap made from the bark, branches and leaves of E. edulis is used to wash dogs with skin disease. In Peru, the seed is mixed in a liquid concoction to treat inflammation of the bladder. The flowers are used to treat eye irritations.
Nitrogen fixing: E. edulis forms a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Rhizobium in the cowpea miscellany. Large nodules form in the upper soil surface and decrease in size with increasing soil depth. 
Live fence posts are established from stakes as support for vine crops.
Soil improver: The fallen leaves provide leaf litter."
Erythrina fusca,"Local names:

Erythrina fusca is a medium to large spreading tree, reaching 10-15 (max. 26) m tall; crown rounded; trunk short, spiny (spines 1-2 cm long), much branched, sometimes buttressed to 2 m; bark brownish-grey or olive-brown, flaky; branches spreading, spiny; branchelets stout, spineless or aculeate.

Leaves alternate, trifoliate; stipules and stipels orbicular, caducous; petiole up to 25 cm long, sometimes sparsely prickly; rachis up to 5 cm long, petiolule up to 1.5 cm; leaflets ovate to elliptical.

Inflorescence racemose, terminal, appearing when leaves are present, with pale brick-red or salmon flowers in fascicles scattered along the rachis, covered with deciduous, ferruginous hairs, mostly unarmed peduncle up to 13 cm long; rachis 8-30 cm long; pedicel up to 2 cm long; stamens 10, 4-6 cm long, 1 free, 9 united in lower half into staminal tube; pistil 4-6 cm long; ovary densely pubescent.

Fruit a woody, linear compressed pod, dehiscent, slightly constricted between 3-15 seeds; stipe stout, 1.5 cm long; beak 2 cm long, velvety, ferruginously hairy when young, later glabrescent; seeds oblong-ellipsoid, 12-18 x 5-8 mm, dark brown or black.

Erythrina comes from the Greek word ‘eruthros’-red, alluding to the showy red flowers of the Erythrina species. The specific name, ‘fusca’, is a Latin word for tawny or brownish-grey.
Ecology

E. fusca is a pioneer species, most commonly found on the outer margins of swamps on sites that are not permanently flooded.
Native range
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Venezuela
Tree management

Established trees stand regular pruning very well. They start sprouting rapidly and develop strong shoots. E. fusca is managed under a moderate regime of pruning if it is grown as a shade tree for cocoa. The trees are partially pollarded once every 1-2 years, leaving a few branches per tree to regulate light influx to the crop. A 6-month pollarding cycle is used for trees supporting black pepper vines.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox.
E. fusca is a pioneer species, most commonly found on the outer margins of swamps on sites that are not permanently flooded.
When used as a shade or nurse tree, E. fusca is propagated by large cuttings, about 2 m long and 6-10 cm in diameter. Rooting success is excellent provided soil moisture is close to field capacity. E. fusca can also be propagated easily by seed. Fresh seed has a germination capacity of 80-95%.
Poison:  The presence of ant-repellent compounds in the nectar has been reported.
The feasibility of using E. fusca in reforestation projects in the tropics as a nurse tree for other tree species is an alternative that can be explored.
  The young leaves are eaten as a vegetable in Java and Bali, and the flowers in Guatemala.
In Central America, E. fusca is used as a source of fodder.
Farmers occasionally use the dry branches of E. fusca as fuelwood despite claims that the branches do not burn well and produce a lot of ash. It is used more because it is available rather than because it is preferred.
Shade or shelter:  E. fusca is often planted as a shade tree in cocoa and coffee plantations in Central America and less frequently in Southeast Asia. 
Medicine:  The bark is used as a poultice on fresh wounds, and bark or root decoctions against beriberi.
Ornamental:  Like many Erythrina species, E. fusca is often planted for ornamental purposes.
In Costa Rica, E. fusca is occasionally used in live fences although much less commonly than E. berteroana and other Erythrina species. The tree is also used as a support for black pepper vines.
Soil improver:  In Bahia, Brazil, it has been observed that cocoa trees planted near E. fusca produce more pods than those growing farther away from the shade trees. This is attributed to increased litter fall in plantations with this species, which adds to the available amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil.
Intercropping:  Where rainfall is irregular and sometimes below 1000 mm per year, E. fusca has been noted to persist in prolonged drought without losing its leaves, recirculating nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium from prunings. It is therefore a promising species for agroforestry systems in such areas where it would be intercropped with maize and cassava."
Erythrina indica,"Local names:
 Bengali (palte,madar), Burmese (kathit), English (Indian coral tree,coral tree), Hindi (pangri,dadak), Malay (dedap), Tamil (mulu murungu)
Erythrina indica is a medium-sized, spiny, deciduous tree normally growing to 6-9 m (occasionally 28 m) tall and 60 cm dbh. Young stems and branches are thickly armed with stout conical spines up to 8 mm long, which fall off after 2-4 years; rarely, a few spines persist and are retained with the corky bark. Bark smooth and green when young, exfoliating in papery flakes, becoming thick, corky and deeply fissured with age.

Leaves trifoliate, alternate, bright emerald-green, on long petioles 6-15 cm, rachis 5-30 cm long, prickly; leaflets smooth, shiny, broader than long, 8-20 by 5-15 cm, ovate to acuminate with an obtusely pointed end. Leaf petiole and rachis are spiny.

Flowers in bright pink to scarlet erect terminal racemes 15-20 cm long; stamens slightly protruding from the flower.

Fruit a cylindrical torulose pod, green, turning black and wrinkly as they ripen, thin-walled and constricted around the seeds. 

There are 1-8 smooth, oblong, dark red to almost black seeds per pod.

Erythrina comes from the Greek word ‘eruthros’ meaning red, alluding to the showy red flowers of the Erythrina species.
Ecology

E.indica is indigenous to the low-elevation deciduous forests of South Asia, found widely scattered throughout the region on plains and undulating terrain up to  about 750 m elevation. 

The tree occurs in a wide range of soils frequently on deep alluvial loams, silts and clays. On gravelly skeletal soils, its growth is normally stunted. It is somewhat frost-sensitive, tender shoots dying back but quickly re-grows under favourable conditions.

Preferred rainfall is in the range 500-1500 mm annually; survives with less when planted along water courses or irrigation channels
Native range
India
The seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Seeds germinate well (60-75% for fresh seeds); they can be stored for a long time if kept in cool, dry and insect free conditions. There are about 4500-6250 seeds/kg.

Preferred rainfall is in the range 500-1500 mm annually; survives with less when planted along water courses or irrigation channels
Natural regeneration occurs freely by self-seeding.  On good sites, it tends to be weedy. Artificial propagation is most easily and quickly done by inserting large branch cuttings into moist ground; they quickly take root and may flower in the same year. Direct sowing also succeeds easily.  Seeds are obtained by collecting the pods in June, threshing and sieving or sorting by hand.  No seed pre-treatment is required.  There are about 4 500-6 250 seeds/kg. Planting nursery seedlings is not as successful as planting stumps, prepared by pruning to 3-5 cm top and 20-25 cm root.
 The new leaves are eaten in curries
Fodder: Used as livestock fodder when lopped as it is rich in nitrogen (4% of dry weight)
Fibre: the bark is stringy and provides a strong fibre that is used in rope making.
Timber: The wood is light, soft, does not split and neither warps, making it suitable in applications where heavy wood is unsuitable such as in small curved articles.
Shade or shelter: It is often planted as a shade tree in cacao and coffee plantations in Southeast Asia 
Tannin and Dyestuffs: A red dye is extracted from its flowers.
Medicine: the bark decoction is used in stomach disorders, anti-abortion treatment, malarial fever and liver problems
Ornamental: E. indica is a large handsome tree. It flowers at 3-4 m tall, making it a popular garden or park plant
In India, it is planted as a live hedge around cultivated gardens. When the cuttings are stuck on the ground, they root quickly to give live hedges. It has been used India as support for pepper and grape vines, by virtue of

Erythrina poeppigiana,"Local names:
 English (coral tree,mountain immortelle), French (bois immortelle), Indonesian (dadap), Spanish (amapola de sombra,amasisa,barbatusco,brucayo,bucare,búcare,bucayo,bucayo gigante,amapola,cámbulo,poró gigante,immortelle,madre del cacao,mountain immortelle,
Erythrina poeppigiana is a large tree, growing to 35 m in height and 2 m in diameter. The crown is moderately spreading and the bole tends to be branchless below 10-20 m. Bark is greyish brown or grey, with thornlike protuberances. 

Leaves are alternate, trifoliolate; folioles rhomboid-oval or oval, 15-25 cm long, generally larger in saplings than in big trees; glandular stipules below the paired lateral folioles, large and cup shaped.

Flowers caducous, orange or reddish, produced in racemes; racemes 10-20 cm long; petals 5; stamens 10; anthers brown; upper petal wide and open.

Pods 12-25 cm long, with several seeds, falcate, slightly depressed between seeds, long stalked, pointed at both ends; seeds brown, about 2 cm long, slightly curved, 1-2 cm long, weighing about 183 g each.

Erythrina comes from the Greek word ‘eruthros’-red, alluding to the showy red flowers of the Erythrina species.
Ecology

E. poeppigiana is native to humid and subhumid tropical lowlands, such as the riverine and upland forests of the Amazon and Orinoco Basins, but cultivated and naturalized trees are now found at elevations up to 2000 m.
Native range
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela
Tree management

E. poeppigiana can be planted at a spacing of 8 x 8 m for unpruned trees and 6 x 6 m for pruned trees. The seedling survival is generally good, but weed control may be necessary during the 1st year to enhance growth. A formation pruning is recommended about 4-6 months after planting to remove the lowest branches. Normal pruning management may start 9-12 months after planting. Tall crops should not be associated with E. poeppigiana before the 1st complete pruning, but low crops may be planted at the time of formation pruning. In coffee plantations in Costa Rica, E. poeppigiana is usually pruned completely and lopped to a height of 2-3 m twice a year to promote coffee flowering and ripening of berries. Due to the slow recovery of carbohydrate reserves, pruning E. poeppigiana more often than twice a year risks the debilitation and turnover of trees within a few years. Pruning trees periodically will prevent complete leaf fall, and pruning trees once a year is enough to impede flowering.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. The seeds may be stored for several years in tightly closed containers in a cool, dry place (about 5 deg. C, 30-40% r.h.). There are about 4500 seeds/kg. Immersing the seeds in water at room temperature for 24 hours enhances germination. The germination rate is about 70%.
E. poeppigiana is native to humid and subhumid tropical lowlands, such as the riverine and upland forests of the Amazon and Orinoco Basins, but cultivated and naturalized trees are now found at elevations up to 2000 m.
Vegetative propagation methods used include air-layering, where the roots appear after about 6 weeks. The leaves must be removed before planting and the top cut made at an angle of 45 degrees and sealed with paraffin. Cuttings should be long (over 1.5 m). Stakes from lower and middle sections of 1- and 2-year-old branches give best results. Cuttings are planted at a depth of 30 cm. Inoculation of seeds or cuttings with Bradyrhizobium bacteria is not generally required in areas where E. poeppigiana is native or naturalized. However, inoculation is recommended when introducing the species to new areas.
The green leaves of E. poeppigiana have a good nutritive value (20-22% of dry matter), are high in crude protein (27-34%), and have a good range of in-vitro digestibility (49-57%). However, due to their high cell wall content (55-58%), they should be supplemented with energy sources, such as tropical grasses, which are readily degradable in the rumen. The presence of potentially toxic alkaloids in the leaves of E. poeppigiana has not affected the health of cattle or goats, but feeding leaves to non-ruminants may be risky.
Although the wood is light, with low calorific value, it is sometimes used as a firewood.
Shade or shelter:  Planted as a shade tree in cacao plantations in the humid tropics, E. poeppigiana conserves soil and contributes to high and sustainable cacao yields.
Nitrogen fixing:  E. poeppigiana nodulates abundantly with nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Bradyrhizobium. Peak values exceeding 1000 kg/ha of nodules have been reported for unpruned cacao shade trees.
Soil improver:  The green leaves of E. poeppigiana contain 4.1-4.9% nitrogen, which makes it an excellent species for green manure production. Production of nitrogen-rich litter is abundant, and the nitrogen supply in litter fall exceeds several times the export of nitrogen in the cacao harvest. The nitrogen supplied through pruning residues left on the ground fulfils recommended nitrogen application rates.
Intercropping:  For alley cropping, E. poeppigiana should be planted in dense hedgerows (1-2 m between trees), with wide alleys (6-8 m) between tree rows. High and sustainable bean yield in the alley-cropping system has been observed. In Costa Rica, E. poeppigiana alley cropping has sustained 2 maize crops per year over 8 years without fertilization. Coffee and cacao may also be planted together with the trees."
Erythrina sandwicensis,"Local names:
Erythrina sandwicensis is a small deciduous tree 5-15 m tall with a short, stout, crooked or gnarled trunk, 30-90 cm in diameter. Branches spreading, stiff, crown broad, thin, wider than it is high. Bark smooth, light to reddish brown, becoming slightly fissured and thin with age; with scattered stout grey or black spines up to 1 cm long. Twigs stout, green with yellow hairs when young and scattered blackish spines.

Leaves alternate, compound, 13-30 cm long, with a long slender leafstalk. Leaflets three, short-stalked; terminal leaflet larger than the other two. Leaflets are 4-10 cm long and 6-15 cm wide.
Flower racemes hairy, yellow, stalk up to 7.4 cm. Flowers crowded in a mass, 7.5-15 cm long and short stalked. Flower color may be orange, yellow, salmon, green and white.

Pods approximately 10 cm long and 13 cm broad, flattened, pointed at both ends; containing 1-4 seeds, blackish and slightly narrowed between seeds.

Seeds elliptical, shiny red orange 13-15 mm long.

Erythrina comes from the Greek word ‘eruthros’-red, alluding to the showy red flowers of the Erythrina species.
Ecology

E. sandwicensis is endemic to the leeward side of the Hawaiian Islands in lowland environments. It was once a dominant component of ancient endemic Hawaiian dryland forests. It is found where rainfall is usually concentrated between November and March, and survives extended drought and high winds. It thrives in the hot, dry foothills and lowland dry forest.
Native range
United States of America
Tree management

E. sandwicensis should be planted on sites similar to its natural environment. Sites are recommended that have well-drained soil and receive full sun. Planting holes should contain slow release fertilizers and watered once a week for the first month. If watering is not possible or if conditions are particularly harsh, the leaves of the seedlings may be trimmed or the tops cut off entirely.
To improve germination, seeds should be mechanically scarified by nicking the seed coat and soaking in water (at room temperature) overnight.

It is found where rainfall is usually concentrated between November and March, and survives extended drought and high winds. It thrives in the hot, dry foothills and lowland dry forest.
E. sandwicensis can be easily propagated by seed or cuttings. For nursery propagation 1-litre containers with a 1:1:1 mixture of perlite, vermiculite, and potting soil are suggested. A small amount of 14- 14-14 N-P-K slow release fertilizer can be added to the potting mix. If vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) inoculant is available, it should be mixed in the potting media as well. Seeds should be planted 4 cm deep and inoculated with rhizobia by irrigating the seedlings with a suspension of peat inoculant in water. Seedlings should be kept under shade until the first 2 or 4 true leaves appear and watered as needed. Over watering may cause damping-off. After two weeks, plants should be placed in full sun and watered with liquid fertilizer solution containing N- P-K plus micronutrients.
Cuttings should be a minimum of 2.5 cm in diameter and 30 cm long and air-dried for at least 24 hours before planting. The base of the cuttings can be coated with rooting hormone. The cuttings should be placed in the ground to a depth of at least 15 cm, and the soil kept moist. Sealing the top surface of the cuttings with wax or tree-wound dressing will help to prevent drying out. 
Seedlings are ready for out planting when stems are sturdy and well hardened, after approximately four months in the nursery.
E. sandwicensis is used in revegetation programs of highly eroded areas in Hawaii.
Timber:  Wood is lightweight and was used by ancient Hawaiians for fishing net buoys, surfboards and outriggers on canoes. More recently, wood from the wiliwili has been carved into imitation whale-tooth necklaces.
Tannin or dyestuff: It was also burned to make charcoal for use as color pigment to blend with other ingredients in making paint. 
Nitrogen fixing:  The tree forms a nitrogen fixing symbiosis with Bradyrhizobium species.
It has been frequently planted as a live fence on account of readiness with which it takes root when planted in the ground.
Other services:  The wood, seed and flowers were traditionally used in Hawaii, and the tree is integral to many Hawaiian legends and proverbs."
Erythrina variegata,"Local names:

Deciduous tree, 3-27 m tall with fluted bole and much branched crown; trunk and branches thick and sappy, armed with large, scattered prickles; bark grey or grey-green, furrowed; young shoots stellate pubescent at first, later glabrous; flowering branches often leafless; in cultivation tree often unarmed.

Leaves alternate, trifoliolate; stipules lanceolate, 1-1.5 cm long, caducous; petiole 2-28 cm long, unarmed; rachis 10-12 cm long; petiolule up to 1.5 cm long, at base with globose glandular stipels; leaflets ovate to broadly rhomboid, usually wider than long, 4-25 cm x 5-30 cm, terminal one largest, base rounded or slightly cordate, apex acuminate, entire or sometimes shallowly lobed, thinly coriaceous, green or sometimes strikingly variegated  light green and yellow, glabrescent.

Inflorescence an axillary, dense raceme 10-40 cm long, ferruginous tomentose, lateral near the top of branchlets; peduncle 7-25 cm long; pedicle up to 1.5 cm long; flowers in groups of 3 scattered along the rachis, large, bright red (occasionally white); calyx eventually deeply spathaceous, 2-4 cm long, glabrescent, red; standard ovate-elliptical, 5-8 cm x 2.5-3.5 cm, more than twice as long as wide, shortly clawed, longitudinally conduplicate, recurved, bright red without white veins; wings and keel subequal, 1.5-2.5 cm long, red; stamens 10, monadelphous, 5-7 cm long, vexillar stamen basally connate with the tube for 1 cm, red; pistil with pubescent ovary and glabrous style.

Pod sausage-shaped or long cylindrical, 10-45 cm x 2-3 cm, 1-13-seeded, slightly constricted between the seeds, glabrescent, distinctly veined and exocarp bursting irregularly, indehiscent.

Seed ellipsoid to reniform, 6-20 mm x 5-12 mm, smooth, glossy black, purplish or purplish red-brown.

E. variegata has the typical 'bird flowers' of Erythrina spp.: scentless, strong and elastic to withstand birds hopping about and poking into the flowers.  The flowers in the drooping inflorescences are upturned, which prevents the copious nectar from running out.  The flowers remain open for 2-3 days, but stop screting nectar after the morning of the first day.

Forms with variegated leaves have been classified as botanical varieties; subclassification of the species, however, seems most appropriate at the cultivar level.  A cultivar with a columnar habit has been selected.  It possibly originated in New Caledonia, from where it spread to other tropical and warm temperate areas, including Hawaii and Florida.  It was released in the United States in 1985 as cv. Tropic Coral.

Tree management

Plantation: In India, a spacing of 8-10 m is used when planting E. variegata for shade in coffee plantations; spacing of live stakes for betel and pepper is 2-3 m x 2 m. 

Husbandry: E. variegata can live to about 100 years.  Unpruned trees may attain a height of 15-20 m in 8-10 years. Subsequenly, the growth rate slows down, but the main stem continues to increase in diameter.   In general, rooting is superficial, with most roots in the upper 30 cm of the soil; older trees, however, root deeper. When trees are used to support vines, side branches are lopped at interval of 6-8 weeks, the foliage being used as green manure or fodder.  When planted for shade, lower branches are removed immediately after establishment and only a few high branches are allowed to grow.  Subsequently, the trees are pollarded once per year in the middle of the rainy season. In India, trees used as support for betel vines yield 15-50 kg fodder per year; shade trees in coffee plantations produce about 100 kg fodder and 25-40 kg wood per year.
 
E. variegata is a native of coastal forest communities, from East Africa, through Southeast to Australia..
E. variegata  is usually propagated from large cuttings, 2-3 m long and 5-8 cm in diameter, to ensure that new shoots are above grazing height and to allow fast early growth.  Branch cuttings with the terminal buds are sometimes used in India to obtain tall, straight-stemmed trees.  Propagation by seed is also possible.  Seed germinates in 8-10 days, attaining a transplantable height of 30-50 cm in 8-10 weeks.
Fodder: The leaves to a limited extend are used as fodder.
Fibre: The wood has been tested as a source of pulp for the paper industry.  The fiber is acceptable for pulping, having good length, high flexibility and slenderness ratio and low Rankel's ratio.
Timber: The wood is white and soft, spongy, fibrous and darker towards the centre.  Growth rings are visible.  The density of the wood is 300 kg/m cubic. In New Britain, the wood is used for spears and shields. The light, spongy wood is used in Cambodia as floats for fishing-nets.
Shade or shelter: In southern India, it is occasionally grown as a shade tree for cocoa and coffee; in Java it is not recommended for this purpose as it is leafless for up to a few months per year.
Medicine: The leaves and bark are widely used as cures in many South-East Asian countries.  The bark is used as an antipyretic in Burma (Myanmar), in decoction to treat liver problems in China and intermittent fever in Indonesia.  A decoction of the bark and leaves is used to treat dysentery in Indonesia; sweetened, it is considered a good expectorant.  A decoction of the leaves may also be used to treat mastitis.  The bark has also been used to treat rheumatism and to relieve asthma and coughs. The roots and leaves are often employed to alleviate fever in the Philippines.  Crushed seeds are used to treat cancer and abscesses in Indo-China, and are boiled in a little water as a remedy for snake bites in Malaysia. In India, the root and bark are called 'paribhadra', one of the reputed drugs of Ayurvedic medicine.
Nitrogen fixing: E. variegata forms root nodules and fixes atmospheric nitrogen with Bradyrhizobium bacteria.
Ornamental: As an ornamental tree, the leaves of the variegated forms and the flowers being very showy.
In India, Malaysia and Indonesia E. variegata  is used as live support for betel (Piper betle L.), black pepper (Piper nigrum L.), vanilla (Vanilla planifolia H.C. Andrews) and yam (Dioscorea spp.) vines.  A columnar cultiv

Eucalyptus camaldulensis commonly grows to 20 m tall, occasionally reaching 50 m, with a trunk diameter of 1 (max. 2) m; in open formations has a short, thick bole and a large, spreading crown; in plantations has a clear bole of 20 m with an erect, lightly branched crown; bark smooth, white, grey, yellow-green, grey-green or pinkish grey, shedding in strips or irregular flakes; rough bark occupies the 1st 1-2 m of the trunk.

Leaves grey-blue, alternate, drooping, 8-22 cm long, 1-2 cm wide, often curved or sickle shaped, tapering, short pointed at base.

Inflorescence axillary, solitary, 7-11 flowered; flower buds white, globular-rostrate or ovoid-conical; operculum hemispherical, rostrate or conical, 4-6 x 3-6 mm, obtuse.

Fruit very small capsules at the end of thin stalks, 5-8 mm, valves 4, containing minute seeds.

The genus Eucalyptus was described and named in 1788 by the French botanist l’Héritier. The flowers of the various Eucalyptus species are protected by an operculum, hence the generic name, which is from the Greek words ‘eu’ (well) and ‘kalyptos’ (covered). The specific epithet honours Count Camaldoni in whose garden E. camaldulensis was planted in 1803.
Ecology

Its natural distribution covers most of Australia’s mainland. Under natural conditions, E. camaldulensis occurs typically along watercourses and on floodplains. Very occasionally in southern Australia it extends to hills or ranges, usually in open forest and woodland. It grows under a wide range of climatic conditions, from temperate to hot and from humid to arid zones. The length of the dry season may vary from 0 to 8 months, and the rainfall distribution from a winter maximum in southern regions to a monsoon type with summer rains in northern areas.

Australia
Tree management

Seedling growth may exceed 3 m per year for well-adapted provenances on favourable sites. Spacing varies with management system, from community planting around homes, villages and roads to closely spaced commercial plantations, and depends on the end products required. Application of 100 g of NP or NPK (3:2:1) fertilizer to each tree at planting to assist establishment and early growth is common. Poor competition ability with weeds and the development of an open crown necessitate frequent weeding, up to 3 times a year, until the canopy closes 3-5 years after planting. A thinning of less than 700 stems/ha at 5 years provides posts, poles, fuelwood and pulpwood, leaving the better trees for the production of other products, such as sawn timber after 10 years. Coppices readily. Crown die-back during the dry season as a result of boron deficiency is prevalent in parts of Africa, Asia and South America.
Orthodox storage behaviour for 3-10 years; viability maintained for 4 years in hermitic storage at room temperature; viability maintained for several years in hermitic storage at 3 deg. C with 6-10% mc. A fully grown E. camaldulensis tree may produce a million or more seeds annually, and may continue so for a century  (Lars Schmidt, 2000). There are 700 000-800 000 seeds/kg.

The length of the dry season may vary from 0 to 8 months, and the rainfall distribution from a winter maximum in southern regions to a monsoon type with summer rains in northern areas.
Seeds can be collected from mature trees before the capsules dehisce. No pretreatment is necessary; the optimum temperature for germination is 32 deg. C, but a wide range is tolerated. The germination rate is generally high and can reach almost 100%. The seeds germinate in 4-15 days and attain size ready for planting out in 4-6 months, depending on temperature and watering. Germination is epigeal, and seedlings have bilobed cotyledons. Seedlings are 1st planted in containers in the nursery. E. camaldulensis is suited to mass vegetative propagation. Cuttings from juvenile shoots root readily in about 30% of the genotypes.
Apiculture:  E. camaldulensis is a major source of honey, producing heavy yields of nectar in good seasons. The honey is light gold and of reasonable density with a distinctive flavour. It has been marketed as a straight line for several years. It crystal
The firewood is suitable for industrial use in brick kilns but is not preferred for domestic use because it is too smoky and burns too fast. However, it makes good-quality charcoal.
Fibre:  E. camaldulensis is used for pulp and paper production. It is also planted for hardboard, fibreboard and particleboard.
Timber:  Because of its great strength and good durability, the wood is suitable for many structural applications, for example, railway sleepers, poles, posts, floorings, wharves, ship building and heavy construction. The density of the wood is 900-980 kg/cubic m at 12% mc. In Pakistan, it is a raw material for the chipboard industry. Estimates show that in 1993, 800 tonnes of raw material was from this species (Charles and Naughton, 1994).
Shade or shelter:  E. camaldulensis is widely planted for shade and shelter. In Sudan it is planted to protect crops from blowing sand.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bole yields a gum that can be used as a dye.
Medicine:  The oils are used as an inhalant with steam and other preparations for relief of colds and influenza symptoms. Because of its refreshing odour and its efficiency in killing bacteria, the oil is also used as an antiseptic.
Ornamental:  Its graceful form is attractive for avenues and gardens. It is practicable by judicious trimming to shape it to the requirements.
Intercropping:  With its light crown, E. camaldulensis is well suited for growing in arable fields. Intercropping maize with trees planted at 5 x 5 m gives satisfactory yields.
Essential oil:  Some tropical provenances of E. camaldulensis are rich in 1,8-cineole leaf oil and are potential commercial sources of medicinal-grade eucalyptus oil."
Fagraea racemosa,"Local names:
 English (false coffee tree), Filipino (kukodmon (Bikol)), Indonesian (taji ayam,melingu (Javanese),engkudug biang), Malay (setebal (Peninsular)), Thai (phawa nam)
Fagraea racemosa is a shrub or small to medium-sized tree up to 25(-40) m tall, bole up to 30 cm in diameter, without buttresses, bark surface smooth but becoming narrowly and deeply fissured, pale grey to dark grey-brown, inner bark yellow-brown.

Leaves very variable, from broadly ovate via elliptical to obovate-oblong, lanceolate or rarely even linear, 5-50 cm x 1-23 cm, apex rounded to acute and often short-to long- acuminate, secondary veins distinctly prominent below, petiole 0.2-5 cm long, stipules connate into an ocrea surrounding the stem.

Inflorescence terminal and usually drooping, pedicel with bracteoles at the base; corolla tube funnel-shaped, 2-4 cm long, stigma faintly 2- lobed.

Fruit subglobose to ellipsoid-ovoid, apiculate, bluish or greenish or red when ripe.

F. racemosa is highly variable and several forms have been distinguished. It develops according to the architectural tree model of Roux, having a monopodial orthotropic trunk with continuous growth and plagiotropic branches, but never by apposition.
Ecology

F. racemosa is found in light to dense primary but more often secondary forest on swampy to dry soil, along rivers but also on podzolized sands, in savannas and lalang grassland vegetation. Locally, it is a conspicuous element of early secondary forest on wastelands and poor soils.
Native range
Australia, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vietnam
Tree management

Husbandry: Double stems should be removed. Thinning in cycles of 5 years up to the age of 30 years is appropriate for plantations; thereafter every 10 years. The lower branches are very persistent and pruning these promotes height growth. F. racemosa reproduce easily by means of root suckers and coppice freely; locally, trees may be often pollarded for poles.

It is used as firewood.
Timber: The density of the wood is 700-870 kg/m cubic at 15% moisture content. The wood is used as tembesu, but the timber is often only available in small dimensions. It is used for general construction and combs.
Medicine: A decoction of leaves, bark, roots and flowers is used for medicinal purposes, mainly as a tonic after fever and for pains in the loins, but in the Philippines also as an antidote against snake bites. Wood-tar is used to blacken teeth.
F. racemosa is planted as a live fence."
Faidherbia albida,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (anaboom), Amharic (grar), Arabic (haraz), Bambara (casala), English (white-thorn,white acacia,apple ring acacia,apple ring tree,gao,ana tree,winter thorn), French (arbre blanc,cad,kad), Ndebele (umpumbu,umtungabayeni), Shona (mutsangu), Swahil
Faidherbia albida is one of the largest thorn trees, reaching 30 m in height, with spreading branches and a rounded crown. Bark rough and dark brown, or smooth and greenish-grey; young branches white to ashy grey and characteristically zigzag in shape. Stipules spinescent, straight, about 2 cm long, creamy coloured with brown tips. Slash fibrous, pink to light brown. The roots can grow to 40 m deep.

Leaves with 3-10 pairs of pinnae, each bearing 6-23 pairs of leaflets; leaflets quite large, 3.5-9 x 0.7-3 mm, grey-green. Modified spiny stipules at the base of the leaves, thickened at the base, straight and robust. (The basal thickening is a characteristic distinguishing this species from the acacias with long thorns like A. tortilis ssp. raddiana, A. nilotica and A. seyal).

Flowers in slender, creamy white spikes, 4-14 cm long. Calyx 1-1.7 mm long, glabrous to pubescent with 5 sepals. Corolla 3-3.5 mm long with 5 free petals.

Fruit is an unusual pod, bright orange to reddish-brown, thick, indehiscent, characteristically and conspicuously curled and twisted; large, up to 25 x 5 cm. Each pod contains 10-29 dark brown, ovoid, shiny seeds each measuring 10 x 6.0 mm and separated by thin septum. The seed coat is tough, leathery and waterproof.

The specific epithet ‘albida’ means somewhat whitish, referring to the colour of the stem. The generic name honours Major LLC Faidberbe, governor of Senegal around 1854.
Ecology

F. albida grows on the banks of seasonal and perennial rivers and streams on sandy alluvial soils or on flat land where Vertisols predominate. It thrives in climates characterized by long summers, or a dry season with long days. It tolerates seasonal waterlogging and salinity but cannot withstand heavy clayey soils.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Israel, Kenya, Lebanon, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Republic of, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Pruning in the 2nd year to about half the tree height may be needed to control low branching. Repeated pruning during periods of average biomass production stimulates leaf production. Can be pruned twice a year. Resulting regrowth is especially vigorous in the 1st year but decreases as exploitation continues; trees show stress at the end of the 6th year. Regular lopping (once every 3-4 years) removing 0.4-0.5m³ of foliage (or 35% of the total volume) at the start of the growing season is recommended. However, improper methods of lopping have been observed to cause wounds, predisposing the tree to attack by pathogens. The tree responds well to coppicing.
Early seed collection is recommended to avoid heavy infestation by bruchid beetles. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; there is no loss after 1 year in hermetic storage at 4 deg. C; viability maintained for several years in hermitic storage at 10 deg. C with 6-10% mc. When treated with insecticides and kept in simple closed containers, seed can be stored for several years. There are 11 500-20 000 seeds/kg.
F. albida grows on the banks of seasonal and perennial rivers and streams on sandy alluvial soils or on flat land where Vertisols predominate. It thrives in climates characterized by long summers, or a dry season with long days. It tolerates seasonal waterlogging and salinity but cannot withstand heavy clayey soils.
Propagation is through potted plants and direct sowing. However, direct seeding is not advisable due to the high failure rate. The seed must be removed from the pods immediately since it is invaded by larvae of Bruchid beetles. After lengthy storage prior to sowing, seeds should either be boiled for 7-15 minutes and then cooled slowly or have boiling water poured on them followed by soaking for 24 hours. A solution of 66% sulphuric acid can also be poured on the seeds, left for 4-5 minutes and then be rinsed off with water. These treatments give 40-60 % germination in 6-30 days. Mechanical scarification is reported to yield 95% germination within 8 days of sowing. 

Promising new vegetative propagation methods include cuttings, grafting and multiplication by root fragments.
The plant's spreading root system offers excellent protection to the banks of watercourses.
 During the dry season, people eat the seeds.
Fodder: The leaves and pods are palatable to domestic animals and an important source of protein for livestock in the dry season.
Apiculture: For bee-keepers, it has the advantage of producing flowers at the end of the rains while most of the sahelian species flower just before or during the rains. It therefore becomes the main source of pollen and nectar at this time.
The plant stems are used as fuelwood. The calorific value is estimated at 19.741 kJ/kg of dry wood. Charcoal yields are as low as 17%.
Timber: The heartwood (specific gravity 0.56-0.71) is pale and creamy, brown sapwood slightly paler than the heartwood. The wood is susceptible to staining fungi and pinhole borer when green; therefore, it is left to soak for several months to remove sap and minimize attack by fungi, borers and termites. Even after the most careful seasoning, the boards tend to spring and twist one or two hours after they are sawn. The wood works fairly easily by hand, but a smooth finish is difficult to obtain. Care must be taken when nailing, bolting and joining. It is used to make utensils, canoes, furniture, boxes, drums and oil presses.
 Shade or shelter: F. albida is maintained and protected on farms to shade coffee and to provide shade for livestock in the dry season.
Medicine: The use of bark and roots either externally or internally against respiratory infections, digestive disorders, malaria and other fevers is widespread. The bark is used to clean teeth, as it is believed to contain fluorine; an extract is used for toothache in humans and eye infections in livestock.
Ornamental: A useful ornamental tree for gardens and avenues.
Branches lopped for fencing compounds and livestock enclosures.
Soil improver: F. albida sheds its leaves in the rainy season; therefore, boosting the nutrient status of the soil for the new season’s crops. The fact that the tree is leafless during the rainy season minimizes competition for sunlight with crops and protects them from birds until harvest time. Recommended for integration with maize as an alternative to Leucaena leucocephala."
Faurea saligna,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (Transvaalboekenhout,rooiboekenhout,witboekenhout,bosveldboekenhout,geelboekenhout), Bemba (saninga), English (beachwood,red boekenhout,beechwood,African beech), Lozi (musokoto), Lunda (musokoto), Ndebele (umdwadwa), Nyanja (chiyele,chinsense),
Faurea saligna is usually a small- to medium-sized, slender, graceful, semi-deciduous tree, 7-10 (max. 20) m in height; stem straight or twisted, sometimes swollen at the base, with a diameter of nearly 60 cm. Bark dark greyish-brown to almost black, rough and deeply fissured longitudinally. A spreading, fairly sparse crown develops with age, young branchlets pendent and conspicuously red.

Leaves leathery, long, pointed, narrow, alternate, simple, 6.5-16 x 1.3-2.5 cm, droop downwards gracefully, sometimes somewhat sickle shaped, shiny, fresh green to yellowish-green, turning red in autumn, young leaves pink to bright rosy red, tapering to the base and apex; margin entire, wavy, slightly curved; petiole up to 2 cm long, pink; main vein red, side veins join up to form a long vein just within the margin. Flowers in slender spikes, 12-15 x 2-3 cm, greenish to creamy white during the flowering stage, mauve or pinkish-white in the fruiting stage, honey scented, stalkless; calyx red and hairy.

Fruit a small nutlet, club shaped, brown, with long silky white or yellow hairs, containing a single spherical, hairy seed and slender, persistent, red styles which appear as woolly pinkish-white spikes.

A 1st field impression is that the tree resembles Rhus lancea, but closer inspection reveals the absence of the 3-foliate leaf typical of the latter. The name beechwood arises because the wood resembles that of the European beech. 

The generic name, Faurea, was given as a tribute to the memory of a young soldier and ardent botanist, W.C. Faure; the specific name, saligna, is Latin and means ‘willow’ or ‘willow-like’ and refers to the drooping willow-like leaves and catkins.
Ecology

F. saligna occurs at low-medium altitudes in open woodland and on stony hillsides, sometimes along river banks. In South Africa, its presence is associated with sourveld, turpentine grass and tamboekie grass, and  reportedly can withstand moderate burning, but doesl not survive fierce grass fires. F. saligna is a common and graceful tree of the Transvaal bushveld and lowveld, where it grows in clumps or together in large numbers. In Zimbabwe, it is frequent in woodlands on the central watershed and in escarpment woodland. It is widespread in highland savannah in Kenya, particularly around Mt Kenya, and is found in low- to high-altitude forest as far west as Nigeria. This species of early forest successions is common at the edges of the Impenetrable (Bwindi) Forest and of forests on Ruwenzori and Mufumbiro Mountains in Uganda. The typical form of F. saligna is found throughout Zambia with the exception of Western Province and Kalombo District; here, it is essentially a woodland tree restricted to miombo, Kalahari, and chipya woodland where it is occasional to locally frequent, especially in plateau miombo. There is another variety of this species with broader, glossier leaves, which is confined to the higher rainfall areas of Zambia and  essentially a riparian tree of gallery forest, rarely found in miombo woodland.

These trees are not easy to grow; seeds should be sown fresh for best results; artificial regeneration is also carried out, using seedlings and wildings.
Apiculture:  Flowers produce nectar that is readily collected by honey bees. Honey dark coloured, of high viscosity, granulates slowly and is strongly flavoured. The aroma is rather musty.
Wood makes good firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  The wood is strong, durable, of medium weight, brittle, and pale yellow, red or dark brown. It is beautifully figured, handsomely coarse grained, polishes well, does not warp or shrink and can be worked green, but suffers from gum pockets (cracks in the wood filled with bright yellow gum). It is easy to work and excellent for furniture, cabinet making, internal construction, joinery, doors, wagons, poles, posts, water wheels, panelling and as general-purpose timber. It is not attacked by borers or termites.
Tannin or dyestuff: A red dye is obtained by soaking the wood in water, and the bark can be used for tanning leather.
Medicine: The bark is boiled in broth and taken as a tonic, while roots are boiled and the liquid drunk as a remedy for diarrhoea and indigestion.
Ornamental: It is an attractive tree, suitable for planting in amenity areas.
Trees can be planted as windbreaks.
Intercropping: The species is often left standing in cropland."
Feijoa sellowiana,"Local names:
 English (guavasteen,New Zealand banana,horn of plenty,Brazilian guava,fig guava,pineapple guava), German (fejoa,ananasguave), Portuguese (feijoa,goiaba abacaxí,goiaba verde,goiaba serrana), Spanish (guayaba pina,guayabo chico,guayabo del pais,guayabo gra
Feijoa sellowiana is a shrub or small tree, 3-6 m in height and very branchy. Trunk cylindrical, peeling off in small pieces. Bark pale grey; branches spreading, swollen at the nodes, white-hairy when young.

Leaves evergreen, thick, leathery, opposite, short petioled, bluntly elliptical; 2-6 cm long and 1-3 cm wide; smooth, glossy on upper surface and finely veined, silvery underneath.

Flowers conspicuous, 4 cm wide, bisexual, borne singly or in cluster, stamens long, erect purple or bright red, topped with large, round, yellow anthers; petals 4, oval, fleshy; white tinged with purple on the inside, 1-2 cm long; sepals 4, persistent.

Fruits 5-8 cm long, 3-7 cm in diameter; variable in shape from round to elongated pear shape, with the persistent calyx segments adhering to the apex. Skin waxy, dull blue-green to blue or greyish green, sometimes with a red or orange blush; texture varies from smooth to rough and pebbly. Flesh thick, white, granular, watery; central pulp translucent, enclosing the seeds; sweet or subacid, suggesting a combination of pineapple and guava or pineapple and strawberry flavor, often with overtones of winter green or spearmint. The fruit emits a strong long-lasting perfume, even before it is fully ripe. 

There are usually 20-40, occasionally as many as 100, very small, oblong seeds hardly noticeable when the fruit is eaten.

It is the best known of the 3 species in the genus which the German botanist, Ernst Berger, named after Don da Silva Feijoa, a botanist of San Sebastian, Spain. The specific name honors F. Sellow, a German who collected specimens in the province of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.
Ecology

The feijoa needs a subtropical climate with low humidity. The plant thrives where the weather is cool part of the year and it can withstand temperatures as low as -11.11ºC. It is drought-resistant but needs adequate water for fruit production. The feijoa can tolerate partial shade and slight exposure to salt spray.

The species is widely distributed in the southern part of South America, from lat. 26°S in southern Paraná in Brazil, to lat. 35°S in Uruguay, including northeastern Argentina and southern-central Paraguay. In Brazil there are still wild populations in forests (gallery) and deforested areas on sites at altitudes over 500 m. At these sites, the summer is hot and rainy and the winter reaches temperatures of 0 to 8°C, sometimes dropping to -4°C.
Native range
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay
Tree management

When 60 to 80 cm in height, they are transplanted at a distance of 6 x 3 m or 6 x 2 m, which will give 550 to 850 saplings per hectare. With an average production of 1000 fruits per adult tree and fruits weighing 30 to 60 g, these densities produce yields ranging from 16 to 50 tonnes per hectare. Feijoas respond well to pruning and can easily be shaped to any desired form. The shrubs may be set 1.5 m apart to form a barrier hedge; 1 m apart in a compact foundation planting.

The feijoa requires little care beyond good soil preparation before planting. Subsequent cultivation is inadvisable because of the plant's shallow, fibrous root system which should be left undisturbed. If planted for its fruit, fertilizer should be low in nitrogen to avoid excessive vegetative growth.
Thinning permits easier harvesting. When grown as a hedge, the feijoa responds well to heavy pruning or shearing, but this reduces flower and fruit production.
Seeds are recalcitrant. They are separated by squeezing the seedy pulp into a container, covering with water, and letting the liquid stand for 4 days to ferment. The seeds are then strained out and dried before sowing. The seeds will retain viability for a year or more if kept dry. Germination takes place in 3 weeks.

At these sites, the summer is hot and rainy and the winter reaches temperatures of 0 to 8°C, sometimes dropping to -4°C.
Feijoas are propagated from seed, layering, cutting and grafting. Propagation from seed produces very heterogeneous plants. Consequently, this method is used only in the production of rootstock and in small domestic gardens. Seeds are sown fresh, either in seedbeds, using the conventional technique, or directly into 30 x 20 cm polyethylene bags. They are transplanted into the nursery at a distance of 1 x 0.40 m until they reach a height of 60 to 80 cm, or are grafted with selected varieties. Soil should be sterilized to avoid damping-off. The young plants are transplanted to pots when they have produced their second leaves.
Erosion control:  The shallow root system holds soil and prevents erosion.
  The fresh fruit is widely consumed because of its characteristic flavour and aroma, which are similar to pineapple. The fleshy petals of its beautiful flowers are also appreciated. In addition, there is a wide variety of industrialized products on the market in the form of paste, jam, crystallized fruits, preserves in syrup and liqueur. The flesh can be used in the soft drinks and ice-cream industries.
Timber:  The wood is dense, hard and brittle.
Shade or shelter:  Feijoa is planted as a windbreak around wind-sensitive crops.
Ornamental:  The foliage is attractive at all seasons and is planted as an ornamental. They also make an excellent foundation planting, either singly or as an informal hedge.
When planted close together, the shrubs make a nice hedge, screen, or windbreak."

The wood-apple is native and common in dry plains. It prefers a monsoon climate with a distinct dry season. The tree grows up to an elevation of 450 m in the western Himalayas.
The wood-apple is generally grown from seeds. Multiplication may also be by root cuttings, air-layers, or by budding onto self-seedlings to induce dwarfing and precociousness.
  The rind must be cracked with a hammer. The scooped-out sticky pulp, is eaten raw with or without sugar, or is blended with coconut milk and palm-sugar syrup and drunk as a beverage, or frozen as an ice cream. It is also used in chutneys and for making jelly and jam. The pulp represents 36% of the whole fruit. The pectin content of the pulp is 3-5% (16% yield on dry-weight basis) and has potential for multiple uses. Seeds contain bland, non-bitter, oil high in unsaturated fatty acids.
The tree is lopped for fodder.
The wood serves as fuel.
Timber:  Wood is yellow-grey or whitish, hard, heavy, durable, and valued for construction, pattern-making, agricultural implements, rollers for mills, carving, rulers, and other products. 
Medicine: The fruit is used in India as a liver and cardiac tonic, and when unripe, as an astringent means of halting diarrhoea and dysentery and effective treatment for hiccough, sore throat and diseases of the gums. The pulp is poulticed onto bites and stings of venomous insects, as is the powdered rind.  Juice of young leaves is mixed with milk and sugar candy and given as a remedy for biliousness and intestinal troubles of children. The powdered gum, mixed with honey, is given to overcome dysentery and diarrhea in children.  Oil derived from the crushed leaves is applied on itch and the leaf decoction is given to children as an aid to digestion. Leaves, bark, roots and fruit pulp are all used against snakebite. The spines are crushed with those of other trees and an infusion taken as a remedy for menorrhagia. The bark is chewed with that of Barringtonia and applied on venomous wounds. 
Gum or resin:  The trunk and branches exude a white, transparent gum; especially following the rainy season utilized as a substitute for, or adulterant of gum arabic, and also in making artists' watercolors, ink, dyes and varnish. It consists of 35.5% ara

Medicine: The ripe fruit is cooling and relieves foul taste, thirst, biliousness, diseases of blood and heart; it is a laxative and helps digestion. It is used for medicinal purposes, such as toothaches. Dried fruit cure asthma; seeds are useful in urinary discharge; young bark is an astringent.
Ornamental: This tree is occasionally planted for amenity purposes, especially in landscaping due to its aesthetic shape and form.
Intercropping: Its large size, wide crown and spreading branches limits it’s agroforestry potential for intercropping  with crops , or  as a hedgerow planting.
Latex or rubber:  Bird-lime can be prepared from its milky juice. 
Other services: The species is mostly planted near Buddhist temples as it is referred to as sacred in India. Hindus associate the tree with fertility in women. It is also an important host to lac insects."
Ficus subcordata,"Local names:
 Filipino (balete), Indonesian (wunut), Thai (sai)
Strangling deciduous tree, without aerial roots, up to 30 m tall and 70 cm in diameter; branching starts 2 m above the ground and twigs are brownish-grey; in shallow soil the lateral roots near the soil surface can spread 4-7 m away from the base of the trunk.  Bark whitish-grey, slightly smooth and fissured, flexible and durable, 10-17 mm thick; inner bark whitish, exuding white sap.  The blunted spearhead-like bud extends from the node while the leaf is still intact. 

Leaves alternate, oblong, ovate-oblong, or elliptical, 9-20 cm x 4-10 cm, with a prominent light green midrib and a light green petiole of 2-5 cm length; leaf margin entire; leaf-blade broadly cuneate or rounded at base, pointed at apex, smooth to hairy, purple when young, light green beneath and dark green above when mature.

Fruit a short-ellipsoid fig, 3-5 cm x 2-2.5 cm, solitary, occasionally in pairs, green when young, gradually turning from yellow to reddish-brown or black when ripe.

Seeds small, hard and numerous.

F. subcordata is subdivided into two varieties by Corner: var. subcordata, the typical variety; and var. malayana Corner, with large subcylindrical figs 3.5-5 cm x 2-2.5 cm, and elliptical to narrowly obovate, thick leaves, 11-16 cm x 4-7 cm, occuring in Peninsular Malaysia and in northern Borneo.
Ecology

In Indonesia, F. subcordata grows well in dryland and hilly areas.
Native range
Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam
Tree management

Plantation: F. subcordata can be planted at 5-10 m spacing when used as fence border and at 10 m x 10 m within and between rows spacings when used as windbreak or fodder bank.

Husbandry: When planted as a cutting, it can be lopped 3 years after planting.  Complete defoliation can be carried out before the end of the dry season every year, or partial defoliation twice during the wet season and twice during the dry season.  For accumulation of in situ fodder, the tree should be lopped 3-4 months before the dry season so that the foliage is well developed during the dry season, otherwise the leaves will shed during the period of flower and seed formation.

The annual fodder and firewood DM yields of a 3-year-old F. subcordata range from 12-20 kg and 30-65 kg per tree respectively.  As the tree grows older, the annual fodder and firewood DM yields can increase up to 140-225 kg and 240-350 kg per tree respectively.  The foliage of a 25-year-old tree can feed one animal of 250 kg live weight for 20-30 days.

Many species can be grown with F. subcordata including grasses such as Cenchrus ciliaris L., Panicum maximum Jacq. and Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) Dandy; herbaceous legumes such as Stylosanthes hamata (L.) Taub., Stylosanthes scabra Vogel, and Centrosema pubescens Benth.; shrub legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk) de Wit and Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp. and fodder trees such as Lannea coromandelica (Houtt.) Merrill and Hibiscus tiliaceus L.
Weight of a fresh fruit ranges from 10-20 g, and there are 1000-2000 ripe seeds per g.
In Indonesia, F. subcordata grows well in dryland and hilly areas.
Even though F. subcordata can be propagated by seed or layering, propagation by cuttings is most commonly practised by farmers.  For direct planting, healthy and straight 2-year-old stems of 5-10 cm in diameter and 1.5-2.5 m length are cut from the parent tree.  The end to be planted should be even and free from splitting, and any leaves and twigs should be removed.  Each cutting should be planted in a prepared hole of 25 cm depth and 15 cm width, then covered with soil in such a way that the planted stem cannot move.  Direct planting should be carried out at the onset of the rainy season, since planting during the wet season causes the buried cambium to rot.  Twelve weeks after planting 75% of the cuttings can develop buds and about 70% survive after 52 weeks.  Twenty-six weeks after planting a cutting, there can be 8-13 main branches of 45-55 cm length and 10-12 leaves per branch.

For planting in nurseries, twigs with 50-100 cm length are inserted in 10-15 cm of soft and moist soil.  Such cuttings are not ready for transplanting until the roots are well developed.  Since F. subcordata seed is very small, it is preferably sown under nursery conditions.  Under favourable conditions the small seeds will germinate in 3-4 weeks.  After development of the cotyledons and a few secondary leaves, seedlings should be transplanted into pots.  Planting into permanent sites is carried out during the rainy season when the plants are 6-12 months old.
Fodder: The foliage of F. subcordata is used as a feed supplement during the wet season and as the sole diet during the dry season for ruminants in some dryland farming areas.  The young fruit can be fed to ruminants. The leaves contain 1.2-1.8% N, crude fibre 26-30%, N-free extract 42-47%, ash 8-11%, total digestible nutrient 33-35% and massic energy of DM is 10 000-19 000 kJ/kg.
The wood is used as fuel for brick and limestone kilns, and the smaller branches are used for household firewood.
Timber: The timber is not hard enough for building houses, making farm implements or woodcarving.
Shade or shelter: The tree is used as shade for livestock, for storing crop residues, for reclamation of denuded land, for protecting soil on sloping land and as a windbreak."
Ficus sycomorus,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (sycomorusvy,rivierwildevy), Amharic (shola,bamba), Arabic (subula), Bemba (mkunyu), English (wild fig,strangler-fig,Sycamore,sycamore fig,bush fig,common cluster fig), French (figuier sycomore,Sykomore), Lozi (mukuyu,katema), Luganda (mukunyu)
Ficus sycomorus is a large, semi-deciduous spreading savannah tree, up to 21 (max. 46) m, occasionally buttressed. Bark on young stems pale green with a soft powdery covering; on older stems, grey-green, fairly smooth, with scattered grey scales and pale brown patches where scales have fallen off. Slash pale pink with heavy latex flow.

Leaves broadly (ob)ovate or elliptic, base (sub)cordate, apex rounded or obtuse, margin entire or slightly repand -dentate, 2.5-13 (max. 21) x 2-10 (max. 16) cm, scabrous above, petiole 1-5 cm, 5-7 pairs of yellow lateral veins, lowest pair originating at the leaf base.

Flowers, unisexual, cyclic and greenish.

Figs in leaf axils or on up to 10 cm leafless branches on old wood, solitary or paired, globose or (ob)ovoid, yellow-red to reddish-purple when ripe, up to 3.5 x 5 cm, pubescent or almost glabrous. Seeds, numerous, round and very tiny.

Ficus is the Latin for fig, derived from the Persian ‘fica’. In Greek ‘syka’ means fig. The species name comes from the Greek ‘sykamorea’ (sycamore), used in the Gospel according to St. Luke; it was such a tree that Jesus cursed because it was barren. But the word ‘sykomorom’ had been used to denote the fruit a century before Christ. It has since been applied as a popular name to many sorts of tree, including Acer pseudoplatanus and Platanus ocidentalis.
Ecology

A common savannah tree that grows in high water table areas. Often found along watercourses such as streams and rivers, swamps and waterholes. The sycamore fig is sensitive to frost but can withstand some cold. It is found in afro-montane rain forests and undifferentiated afro-montane forests, especially along edges and in clearings, riverine forests, riparian woodland, secondary evergreen bushland; left as single trees in farmland and occasionally seen as single trees on rocky outcrops.
Native range
Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Israel, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

The sycamore fig is large, spreading and very shady, and therefore requires considerable spacing. It tolerates lopping. Continuous and adequate water supply is necessary for high yields, but rainfall during fruiting may cause fruits to split and favour growth of fungal rots. The best site for trees is next to drainage lines, streams, rivers, springs or dams. A tree can bear several crops of fruit a year. The invasive root system should be borne in mind when positioning trees. Wild fig does well in a container if pruned once or twice a year. Growth rate is fairly fast at 1-1.5 m/year in frost-free areas.
Viable seed is difficult to obtain.

It is found in afro-montane rain forests and undifferentiated afro-montane forests, especially along edges and in clearings, riverine forests, riparian woodland, secondary evergreen bushland; left as single trees in farmland and occasionally seen as single trees on rocky outcrops.
As viable seed is difficult to obtain, it is preferable to cultivate this tree from cuttings or truncheons. Branches with a diameter of 50-150 mm are the best to use for truncheons; to avoid rotting of the tips, they must be left in the shade for a few days to dry before planting. Most of the leaves should be removed before planting in 1-m deep holes with some sand at the bottom. This prevents rotting of the truncheon and stimulates root formation. Cuttings can be made from either hardwood or softwood. They are 1st planted in the nursery to induce rooting and then planted out in the field. Alternatively, cuttings may be planted directly on site. It is best to protect young plants from frost until they reach a height of 1 m or more. This will also protect the plants from being defoliated by browsers.
Erosion control: Wild fig can be used for sand-dune fixation and riverbank stabilization.
 Mature fruits are eaten fresh, stewed, or dried and stored for later use. Fruit can also be used for the preparation of an alcoholic beverage. Leaves are used in soups and groundnut dishes. The bark is chewed together with kola nut. In Ghana, the wood ash is commonly used as a salt substitute.
Fodder: Leaves are a much-sought fodder with fairly high nutritive value (9% crude protein and 7 mJ/kg net energy dry matter); they are valuable fodder in overstocked semi-arid areas where the trees occur naturally. Fruits are eaten by livestock, wild animals and birds.
Can be used as firewood and for making charcoal; various peoples throughout Africa use a piece of dry wood from this tree as the base block when starting a fire by the friction method.
Fibre: Inner part of the root used as weaving fibre, and a strong rope can be made from the inner bark.
Timber: The wood is creamy brown, has a fairly uniform structure, is very light (air-dry 510 kg/m³), soft to moderately hard, tough, strong, easy to work, finishes smoothly and holds nails firmly. It is not very durable and is easily attacked by termites. Mainly used for making mortars and pestles, drums, stools, doors, beehives, dugout canoes, carvings and for house building.
Shade or shelter: The tree gives useful shade and is common at marketplaces, where people gather under it for many social functions.
Medicine: The bark is used for the treatment of scrofula, coughs, and throat and chest diseases. The milky latex is used for treatment of dysentery and chest diseases, or is applied to inflamed areas, while ringworm is treated with the bark and milky latex. Leaves are said to be effective against jaundice and as an antidote for snakebite, while the roots have laxative and anthelmintic properties.
Ornamental: An important tree planted for ornamental purposes near temples, roadsides, wells and community places such market centres in rural areas. The yellowish bark shows at an early stage, contrasting well with the green leaves. A popular species to grow as a bonsai.
Soil improver: Shed leaves form a valuable litter improving the nutrient status, infiltration rate and water-holding capacity of the soil.
Intercropping: Usually intercropped with bananas as an understorey.
Other services: The sycamore fig is widely valued for spiritual and sacred purposes. Such use can be traced back to ancient Egypt, and it is often mentioned in the Holy Bible"
Ficus thonningii,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (gewone wurgvy), Arabic (jammeiz al abiad), English (strangler fig,common wild fig,bark-cloth fig), French (India-laurel fig), Fula (bikeshi), Hausa (chediya), Shona (gerina), Spanish (Laurel,álamo jagüey,Arbol de Washington), Swahili (mtschamw
Ficus thonningii is an evergreen tree 6-21 m, with a rounded to spreading and dense crown. Sometimes epiphytic, often a strangler; trunk fluted or multistemmed. Bark on young branches hairy, with a stipular cap covering the growth tip, but smooth and grey on older branches and stems, lenticellate, often with aerial roots hanging down from branches; the whole plant exudes a copious, milky latex often turning pinkish.

Leaves simple, glossy, dark green, thin and papery or slightly leathery, margin smooth, elliptic or obovate, sometimes rather elongated or slightly oblanceolate, grouped at ends of twigs, 3-20 x 1.5-10 cm, glabrous, puberulous or pubescent; with 6-12 pairs of upcurving main lateral veins; stalk rather slender, 1-7.5 cm; base cuneate or obtuse (sometimes subcordate); apex rounded or obtuse, sometimes shortly and bluntly acuminate. Stipules about 12 mm long, soon falling off.

Figs in leaf axils, sometimes below the leaves, enclosing many small flowers, mostly hairy and borne in the leaf axils, sessile or on peduncles to 10 mm long, yellow or red, globose or ellipsoid, 7-14 mm in diameter, smooth or warted, glabrous or pubescent, basal bracts 2-4 mm long, persistent.

The generic name is the classical Latin name for the cultivated fig derived from the Persian word ‘fica’, and the specific epithet is in honour of Danish plant collector Peter Thonning (1775-1848).
Ecology

The species is widely distributed in upland forest, open grassland, riverine and rocky areas and sometimes in savannah. It occurs naturally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania in the north to the Eastern Cape in South Africa. Trees are relatively drought resistant.

Tree management

F. thonningii requires wide spacing because of its spreading crown. It should be protected from browsing at the initial stages of establishment. It is tolerant to pruning and lopping.
The species is widely distributed in upland forest, open grassland, riverine and rocky areas and sometimes in savannah. It occurs naturally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania in the north to the Eastern Cape in South Africa. Trees are relatively drought resistant.
In the wild, the tree starts its life as an epiphyte, usually germinating from a seed dropped by a dispersal agent. Trees are commonly planted using 20-50 cm long cuttings from which most of the leaves have been removed. Rooted cuttings are planted in the nursery and kept moist; but inserting cuttings directly in the field is also feasible. Seedlings raised in a nursery are also used. This species grows easily from truncheons that are left in the shade for a few days to dry before planting. River sand should be placed at the bottom of the planting hole, to prevent the bottom of the truncheon from rotting. It grows quickly into a fair-sized tree but is sensitive to cold winds. In the colder regions, young plants must be protected for the first 2-3 years.
Erosion control: Truncheons can be planted close to each other to help control erosion.
 A good jam can be made from the ripe fruits.
Fodder: Livestock eat the dry leaves on the ground and to a lesser degree fresh leaves. Leaves and twigs are eaten by bushbuck, dikdik, elephant, giraffe, impala, kudu and nyala. Dropped fruits are eaten by baboon, bushbuck, bushpig, civet, dikdik, grey duiker, rock and tree hyrax, impala, kudu, slender mongoose, samango and vervet monkeys, nyala, porcupine and warthog. The ripe fruits are eaten by bats, barbets, bulbuls, louries (turacos), parrots, pigeons and starlings.
Branches are used for firewood.
Fibre: Bark cloth is obtained by cutting out a strip or cylinder of bark, which causes the tree to produce a fine, matted covering of red, slender roots over the wound. Bark fibre is used for making mats; the twined bark produces a strong rope, which is mostly used for fastening bundles of firewood before they are carried to the homestead for fastening slates onto a roof.
Timber: The wood is creamy brown, has a fairly uniform structure, is light (510 kg/cubic m), soft to moderately hard, with a rough texture, tough, strong, easy to work; it finishes smoothly and holds nails firmly. Its durability is low, and it is easily attacked by termites.
Shade or shelter: F. thonningii is often planted to offer cover from the scorching sun in recreational areas, market centres and schoolyards. It can also be planted to provide shelter during the cold winter months.
Medicine: The bark is important in local medicine, and it is used in treating colds, sore throat, dysentery, wounds, constipation, nosebleed and to stimulate lactation. Latex is used for wound fever, while an infusion of the root and fibre is taken orally to help prevent abortion. Powdered root is taken in porridge to stop nosebleed; the milky latex is dropped into the eye to treat cataracts.
Ornamental: This tree has an aggressive root system and should not be planted in a small garden or near buildings, swimming pools or paths. It makes an ideal shade tree in a large garden or park, and it makes a successful container plant for the patio. It is also ideal for use as a bonsai specimen.
Soil improver: Leaf litter helps in the improvement of the nutrient status and water-holding capacity of the soil.
Intercropping: In Uganda, the tree is intercropped with coffee and bananas.
Latex or rubber: A considerable amount of useful latex is produced by the tree."
Flacourtia indica,"Local names:

Flacourtia indica is a tree or shrub usually 3-5 m tall, sometimes 10 m. Bark is usually pale, grey, powdery, may become brown to dark grey and flaking, revealing pale orange patches. Vegetative parts vary from glabrous to densely pubescent. 

Leaves red or pink when young, variable in size, oval to round, to 12 cm, edge toothed, becoming leathery; 4-7 pairs of veins clear on both surfaces; stalk to 2 cm. 

Flowers unisexual or occasionally bisexual (1 or several branches of a female specimen with perfect flowers, which, however, bear fewer stamens than the males). Male flowers in axillary racemes 0.5-2 cm long; pedicles slender, may be pubescent, up to 1 cm long, the basal bracts minute and caducous. Sepals (min. 4) 5-6 (max. 7), broadly ovate, apex acute to rounded, pubescent on both sides, 1.5-2.5 mm long and broad. Filaments 2-2.5 mm long; anthers 0.5 mm long. Disk lobulate. Female flowers in short racemes or solitary; pedicles up to 5 mm. Disk lobulate, clasping the base of the ovoid ovary; styles 4-8, central, connate at the base, spreading, up to 1.5 mm long; stigmas truncate. 

Fruit globular, reddish to reddish-black or purple when ripe, fleshy, up to 2.5 cm across, with persistent styles, up to 10-seeded. Seeds 5-8, 8-10 x 4-7 mm; testa rugose, pale brown.

The botanical name is of particular historical and geographical interest in South Africa. ‘Flacourtia’ honours  E. de Flacourt (1607-60), a governor of Madagascar, who knew the Cape before van Riebeeck, and indica indicates that the east is equally the home of this little tree of the Transvaal bushveld.
Ecology

F. indica is a common in tropical dry deciduous and thorn forests, though more abundant in the former. It also occurs in seasonally dry forest, woodland, bushland, thickets, wooded grassland, and often in riparian vegetation. The species is drought resistant though somewhat frost tender.
Native range
Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zanzibar, Zimbabwe
Tree management

F. indica is a slow-growing tree. In Tamil Nadu, India, coppice shoots reached 3.4 m in height and 9.4 cm in girth in 15 years, corresponding to a mean annual increment of only 0.63 cm. It coppices very well. Seedlings need weeding until they are well developed.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for over 1 year in air-dry hermetic storage at 5 deg. C.
F. indica is a common in tropical dry deciduous and thorn forests, though more abundant in the former. It also occurs in seasonally dry forest, woodland, bushland, thickets, wooded grassland, and often in riparian vegetation. The species is drought resistant though somewhat frost tender.
The natural reproduction of the species is satisfactory, being aided by the wide dispersal of seeds by birds. Young seedlings and saplings, being drought resistant, are able to maintain their proportion in existing stands and even to spread to new localities even though they are readily browsed. Can be propagated from seed, but germination behaviour is unknown; however, the species is of little economic importance so is rarely raised by seed.
  Fruit are edible and can be eaten raw or stewed. They have high potential for processing into jams and jellies. Ripe fruits are often dried and stored as food.
Browsed by game. Branches and leaves lopped for cattle in India.
Wood used for firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  The sapwood is light brown, gradually merging into the chocolate-brown heartwood. It is very hard, heavy to very heavy (850 kg/m³), straight grained and durable, though liable to splitting. It has a fine even texture. Used for agricultural implements such as ploughs, posts, building poles, rough beams, walking sticks and the manufacture of turnery articles. The small size of the wood limits its usefulness.
Tannin or dyestuff: Bark is used as a tanning material. 
Medicine: The leaf is carminative, astringent and used as a tonic, an expectorant and for asthma, pain relief, gynaecological complaints and as an antihelmintic, and treatment for hydrocele, pneumonia and intestinal worms. The Lobedu tribe of southern Africa take a decoction of the root for the relief of body pains. In India, an infusion of the bark is used as a gargle for hoarseness. In Madagascar, the bark, triturated in oil, is used as an anti-rheumatic liniment. The root and ash have been used as a remedy for kidney complaints.
Ornamental: The glistening leaves of F. indica can be very attractive when the tree is planted as an ornamental. 
When closely planted, it forms a close impenetrable barrier that serves as a hedge; it tolerates frequent trimming.
Alcohol: The fruit can be fermented to produce wine. "
Flemingia macrophylla,"Local names:

Flemingia macrophylla is a woody, deep-rooting, tussock-forming shrub, 1-4 m tall. Young branches greenish, ribbed, triangular in section and silky. Old stems brown, almost round in section.

Leaves digitately trifoliate; stipules lanceolate, 1-1.5 cm long, covered with silky hairs, early caducous; petiole up to 10 cm long, narrowly channelled, slightly winged; leaflets elliptical-lanceolate, 6-16 x 4-7 cm, papery, dark green, base rounded, veins covered with silky hairs, apex rounded to acuminate.

Inflorescence a dense axillary raceme, sub-spiciform, sessile, 2.5-10 cm long, pale velutinous, green, with 5 lanceolate lobes; corolla with greenish elliptical standard and distinct parallel red veins, wings narrow and much shorter than the keel, light purple at the apex.

Pod oblong, inflated, 8-15 x 5 mm, covered with fine glandular hairs, dehiscent, dark brown, 2-seeded. Seed globular, 2-3 mm in diameter, shiny black.

The specific name, ‘macrophylla’, means large leaved; from the Greek ‘makros’ (large) and ‘phyllon’ (leaf).
Ecology

F. macrophylla can tolerate fairly long dry spells and is capable of surviving on poorly drained soils with waterlogging. The species is found naturally growing along watercourses in secondary forest, as well as under drier conditions such as in fields infested with Imperata cylindrica. It is tolerant of light shade and is moderately able to survive fires.
Native range
Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Province of China, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Good weed control is required during the 1st 6 months of sowing since the plants are relatively slow to establish; once established, they require little attention. Mulching at a rate of 3 t/ha effectively controls the germination of weed seeds for about 3 months. Under tropical, humid, lowland conditions in Cote d’Ivoire, with 10 000 plants/ha and 9 regrowth cycles of 3 months each, an average annual production of 12 t/ha of leaf dry matter has been achieved, although typical yields in Southeast Asia may be closer to 8 t/ha. Plants can be cut more frequently than every 3 months, but preferably not at intervals of less than 40 days. With an excellent coppicing capacity, the shrub will survive under this cutting regime for many years.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. There are 45 000-97 000 seeds/kg.
F. macrophylla can tolerate fairly long dry spells and is capable of surviving on poorly drained soils with waterlogging. The species is found naturally growing along watercourses in secondary forest, as well as under drier conditions such as in fields infested with Imperata cylindrica. It is tolerant of light shade and is moderately able to survive fires.
F. macrophylla is propagated by seed. Standard hot-water treatment ensures good germination. Scarification of the seed is usually required to increase the germination percentage.

A good weed-free seedbed should be prepared, and the necessary fertilizers for a particular soil should be worked in before sowing, or banded under the row of seed. When planting in a new area, seed should be sown with a suitable strain of Bradyrhizobium such as CIAT 4203 or 4215. Planting density varies according to the projected use of the stand.
Erosion control: Grown on terraces to control soil erosion.
Fodder: In some areas, such as Ghana, F. macrophylla remains green throughout the year and retains most of its leaf during the dry season, making it suitable as a dry-season browse species. Palatability of immature herbage is considerably better than that of old mature herbage.
Fuelwood is a valuable byproduct. A 2-year-old stand with a spacing of 0.5 x 4 m can produce about 6.8 t of dry woody stems/ha.
Shade or shelter: A cover and shade crop in young plantations of cocoa, sisal, coffee, banana, plantain, oil palm and rubber; also acts as a good windbreak. In Madagascar, it is planted as a windbreak in tea plantations at Lac Alaotra.
Tannin or dyestuff: One of the sources of the Arab dye called ‘waras’ or ‘warrus’. It is a coarse purple or orange-brown powder consisting of the glandular hairs rubbed from dry Flemingia fruit; capable of dying silk but not wool or cotton, the active component is called flemingin.
Medicine: In Indonesia and Malaysia, the leaves are used medicinally. In China, a decoction is used to bathe sores and swellings, while in Taiwan it is an antipyretic for treating postpartum fever and is used to treat paralysis and pain in the joints.
Nitrogen fixing: F. macrophylla forms root nodules and fixes atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with Bradyrhozobium strains. Root nodules are often difficult to locate, partly because they are very small.
Grown in hedges; promising when used as a live fence. In Malaysia, it is a useful bush to plant with creeping legumes, as it provides support for them to climb on and is deep rooting.
Soil improver: Provides mulch for associated food crops. Owing to the slow decomposition of the leaves, the mulch has long-term effects in weed control, moisture conservation and reduction of soil temperature. Flemingia mulch forms a relatively solid layer that effectively prevents germination of weed seeds or stunts their early development for 100 days.
Intercropping: Grown in alley-cropping systems, used in Cote d’Ivoire in pineapple plantations to control nematode infestation. Grown as an understorey for the Honduras pine (Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis). Useful as a cover crop in perennial plantations."
Fraxinus excelsior,"Local names:
 English (common ash,english ash,European ash,golden ash,venus of the forest), French (Frêne commun,frand frêne), German (esche,gewohnliche Esche,gewoehnliche Esche,gemeine Esche,frassino comune,frassino maggiore), Portuguese (freixo-centro-europeu,frexio
Fraxinus excelsior is a deciduous tree up to 40 m in height. Twigs greenish-grey, bark firm and ridged. Grows in moist areas with deep soil, generally in hollows and gulleys at the medium and subalpine mountain levels.

Leaves large, measuring between 20-35 cm long, divided into 9-13 folioles. These have a lanceolate form, serrated margins and with lamina base touching the principal vein, leaves glabrous except for tufts of hair at the base of the underside of the midrib of each leaflet. Winter buds felted.

Flowers small, polygamous in bunches, lacking petals, flower stigmas long appearing before leaves.

Fruit are slightly twisted ellipsoid samaras 3-5 cm long, with wide wing aiding wind dispersal.

The specific epithet excelsior is the Latin word for “higher”, the generic name is derived from the Greek phraxo (closed), a fence for ash wood is often used in fence making.
Ecology

The common ash is native throughout Europe and into western Asia, where it grows in moist areas with deep soil, generally in hollows and gulleys at the medium and subalpine mountain levels. The European ash is commonly found in meadows and hedgerows where plenty of water is available. Also found growing in scree woods in hilly country but rarely forming monocultural forests. The ash is sensitive to late spring frosts which oftenly damages its terminal shoots, causing the development of twin stems. The European ash is smog resistant.
Native range
Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Russian Federation, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom
Tree management

In naturally regenerated stands, the first tending operation should take place when the crop reaches a top height of 5 m, to eliminate coarse-branched, deformed and cankered trees (4000 stems/ha). A second intervention follows at a top height of 7-8 m (2000 stems/ha).

Forking of the stem occurs frequently in young ash (approximately 60% of all trees in a plantation.).  These, and competitive branches, should be cut when the crop reaches a height of 6-7 m to favour the development of a straight bole.

Thinning begins at 10 m and is repeated for every 2 or 3 m increase in top height, according to site quality.  A strong reduction in stem numbers at the first thinning facilitates crown development at this stage. Thinning intensity is 35% for very good sites and 30% for medium sites. Final crop trees are selected at top heights of 14-15 m.

F. excelsior is a fast growing tree seldom affected by pests or diseases and should be given full light as it does not tolerate shade. The tree needs adequate soil moisture and is susceptible to frost.
F. excelsior seeds are harvested when they turn brown in October/November.  Seeds can be also collected as soon as they fill and can be sown immediately.  A high proportion will germinate in the following.  Storage is classified as orthodox and seeds can be stored for up to 10 years.
The common ash is native throughout Europe and into western Asia, where it grows in moist areas with deep soil, generally in hollows and gulleys at the medium and subalpine mountain levels. The European ash is commonly found in meadows and hedgerows where plenty of water is available. Also found growing in scree woods in hilly country but rarely forming monocultural forests. The ash is sensitive to late spring frosts which oftenly damages its terminal shoots, causing the development of twin stems. The European ash is smog resistant.
Propagation is by seed gathered early in autumn or at the beginning of winter.
Poison: Leaves and fruits are reportedly poisonous to cattle.
Erosion control:  The ash protects soil from denuding forces.
  The fruits were used for food, pickled and eaten with salads.
High quality firewood is obtained from the ash.
Timber:  Ash wood was preferred for axe handles, spears, axles, planks for boat construction and all necessary materials for which the Norwegians were famous  in the middle age wars. Skis were made of ash as well as oars, baseball bats, church pews and bowling alleys. The bark also served as a good writing surface.
Shade or shelter:  F. excelsior  is a popular summer shade tree and an important windbreak.
Medicine: The seeds have long been considered an aphrodisiac. A bark decoction served to control kidney function and as a febrifuge and diuretic. The leaves were used for their cathartic properties. Other medicinal uses of the ash are for vomit induction, peritonitis, as a substitute for cinchona bark, constipation, arthritis, adder bite, intestinal worms, insect bites, malaria, nervous disease, diabetes, syphilis, healing wounds, tuberculosis and dropsy.
Ornamental:  A popular ornamental tree with an attractive upright crown, it is commonly grown in parks, gardens and along avenues. F. excelsior  exists in several ornamental varieties, notably F. excelsior var. pendula which has a broad crown of pendulous branches. 
The European ash is commonly used for fence construction.
Soil improver:  Leaf litter from F. excelsior  replenishes soil nutrients.
Other services:  A lot of cultural value is placed on the tree, it is central to the Norwergian mythology, called Yggdrasil, where it is held that the human race emerged from a hollow ash tree. This is one reason for its importance to the Norwergians. "
Funtumia africana,"Local names:
 English (male funtum,Lagos rubber,bush rubber,bastard wild rubber)
Funtumia africana is a tropical tree up to 30 m tall (usually shorter) with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a narrow tree crown. Bark brown to dark in colour, thin and slightly fissured becoming granular on old trees. Slash orange exuding latex copiously.

Leaves elliptic or ovate, base round or cuneate, apex acuminate 20 x 9 cm, with approximately 8-14 main lateral veins on each side, leaf margins wavy. Axils on the main lateral veins not pitted.

Flowers yellow-white, fragrant in dense cymes. Corolla tube 6-10 mm, lobes 5-7mm. 

Fruit grey-brown, fusiform, with an acute or acuminate apex, up to 30 cm long, with hairy wind borne seeds.

Funtumia africana and F. elastica are very similar morphologically and distribution wise, when F. elastica latex is rubbed between the fingers the latex coagulates into balls, whereas F. africana does not. The generic epithet is derived from ‘funtum’, a local Ghanaian (Akan dialect) name of the plant. The specific epithet means 'of Africa'.
Ecology

A forest tree commonly composing the second storey in rainforests, F. africana is commonly associated with Elaeis guineensis, Kolobopetalum chevalieri, Dioscorea preusii, Cnestis hirsutus, Tabernaemontana crassa and Alstonia congensis, this association is the Tabernaemontano-Elaeetum guineensis typicum. Bastard wild rubber is also common in forest regrowth.

Bastard wild rubber is also common in forest regrowth.
Poison: The latex is a weak ingredient and adherent for poisoned arrows.
Erosion control:  The root system of F. africana protects moist forest soil from erosion.
Apiculture: The fragrant yellow-white flowers are visited by bees for nectar and pollen.
Branches and trunk can be used as fuelwood.
Timber:   F. africana wood is white, even textured with a weight of 64 kg/m³. air dry. It is used for cheap joinery, furniture and matchstick manufacture. The wood is also reportedly used for carving stools, doors and miscellaneous household requirements.
Shade or shelter:  The tree casts a heavy, cool shade.
Medicine:  In Africa this species is used to treat urinary incontinence and burns. The leaf and bark are used as enema. The principle alkaloids of F. africana, funtumine and funtumidine are hypotensive.
Gum or resin:  In Kenya, F. africana latex is used as birdlime.
Soil improver:  Leaf litter improves soil fertility of surrounding soil.
Latex or rubber:  F. africana latex polyisoprenes are useless as a source of rubber, Use of bastard wild rubber latex as an adulterant, leads to imperfect coagulation and consequently a valueless rubber."
Fagraea racemosa,"Local names:
 English (false coffee tree), Filipino (kukodmon (Bikol)), Indonesian (taji ayam,melingu (Javanese),engkudug biang), Malay (setebal (Peninsular)), Thai (phawa nam)
Fagraea racemosa is a shrub or small to medium-sized tree up to 25(-40) m tall, bole up to 30 cm in diameter, without buttresses, bark surface smooth but becoming narrowly and deeply fissured, pale grey to dark grey-brown, inner bark yellow-brown.

Leaves very variable, from broadly ovate via elliptical to obovate-oblong, lanceolate or rarely even linear, 5-50 cm x 1-23 cm, apex rounded to acute and often short-to long- acuminate, secondary veins distinctly prominent below, petiole 0.2-5 cm long, stipules connate into an ocrea surrounding the stem.

Inflorescence terminal and usually drooping, pedicel with bracteoles at the base; corolla tube funnel-shaped, 2-4 cm long, stigma faintly 2- lobed.

Fruit subglobose to ellipsoid-ovoid, apiculate, bluish or greenish or red when ripe.

F. racemosa is highly variable and several forms have been distinguished. It develops according to the architectural tree model of Roux, having a monopodial orthotropic trunk with continuous growth and plagiotropic branches, but never by apposition.
Ecology

F. racemosa is found in light to dense primary but more often secondary forest on swampy to dry soil, along rivers but also on podzolized sands, in savannas and lalang grassland vegetation. Locally, it is a conspicuous element of early secondary forest on wastelands and poor soils.
Native range
Australia, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vietnam
Tree management

Husbandry: Double stems should be removed. Thinning in cycles of 5 years up to the age of 30 years is appropriate for plantations; thereafter every 10 years. The lower branches are very persistent and pruning these promotes height growth. F. racemosa reproduce easily by means of root suckers and coppice freely; locally, trees may be often pollarded for poles.

It is used as firewood.
Timber: The density of the wood is 700-870 kg/m cubic at 15% moisture content. The wood is used as tembesu, but the timber is often only available in small dimensions. It is used for general construction and combs.
Medicine: A decoction of leaves, bark, roots and flowers is used for medicinal purposes, mainly as a tonic after fever and for pains in the loins, but in the Philippines also as an antidote against snake bites. Wood-tar is used to blacken teeth.
F. racemosa is planted as a live fence."
Faidherbia albida,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (anaboom), Amharic (grar), Arabic (haraz), Bambara (casala), English (white-thorn,white acacia,apple ring acacia,apple ring tree,gao,ana tree,winter thorn), French (arbre blanc,cad,kad), Ndebele (umpumbu,umtungabayeni), Shona (mutsangu), Swahil
Faidherbia albida is one of the largest thorn trees, reaching 30 m in height, with spreading branches and a rounded crown. Bark rough and dark brown, or smooth and greenish-grey; young branches white to ashy grey and characteristically zigzag in shape. Stipules spinescent, straight, about 2 cm long, creamy coloured with brown tips. Slash fibrous, pink to light brown. The roots can grow to 40 m deep.

Leaves with 3-10 pairs of pinnae, each bearing 6-23 pairs of leaflets; leaflets quite large, 3.5-9 x 0.7-3 mm, grey-green. Modified spiny stipules at the base of the leaves, thickened at the base, straight and robust. (The basal thickening is a characteristic distinguishing this species from the acacias with long thorns like A. tortilis ssp. raddiana, A. nilotica and A. seyal).

Flowers in slender, creamy white spikes, 4-14 cm long. Calyx 1-1.7 mm long, glabrous to pubescent with 5 sepals. Corolla 3-3.5 mm long with 5 free petals.

Fruit is an unusual pod, bright orange to reddish-brown, thick, indehiscent, characteristically and conspicuously curled and twisted; large, up to 25 x 5 cm. Each pod contains 10-29 dark brown, ovoid, shiny seeds each measuring 10 x 6.0 mm and separated by thin septum. The seed coat is tough, leathery and waterproof.

The specific epithet ‘albida’ means somewhat whitish, referring to the colour of the stem. The generic name honours Major LLC Faidberbe, governor of Senegal around 1854.
Ecology

F. albida grows on the banks of seasonal and perennial rivers and streams on sandy alluvial soils or on flat land where Vertisols predominate. It thrives in climates characterized by long summers, or a dry season with long days. It tolerates seasonal waterlogging and salinity but cannot withstand heavy clayey soils.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Israel, Kenya, Lebanon, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Republic of, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Pruning in the 2nd year to about half the tree height may be needed to control low branching. Repeated pruning during periods of average biomass production stimulates leaf production. Can be pruned twice a year. Resulting regrowth is especially vigorous in the 1st year but decreases as exploitation continues; trees show stress at the end of the 6th year. Regular lopping (once every 3-4 years) removing 0.4-0.5m³ of foliage (or 35% of the total volume) at the start of the growing season is recommended. However, improper methods of lopping have been observed to cause wounds, predisposing the tree to attack by pathogens. The tree responds well to coppicing.
Early seed collection is recommended to avoid heavy infestation by bruchid beetles. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; there is no loss after 1 year in hermetic storage at 4 deg. C; viability maintained for several years in hermitic storage at 10 deg. C with 6-10% mc. When treated with insecticides and kept in simple closed containers, seed can be stored for several years. There are 11 500-20 000 seeds/kg.
F. albida grows on the banks of seasonal and perennial rivers and streams on sandy alluvial soils or on flat land where Vertisols predominate. It thrives in climates characterized by long summers, or a dry season with long days. It tolerates seasonal waterlogging and salinity but cannot withstand heavy clayey soils.
Propagation is through potted plants and direct sowing. However, direct seeding is not advisable due to the high failure rate. The seed must be removed from the pods immediately since it is invaded by larvae of Bruchid beetles. After lengthy storage prior to sowing, seeds should either be boiled for 7-15 minutes and then cooled slowly or have boiling water poured on them followed by soaking for 24 hours. A solution of 66% sulphuric acid can also be poured on the seeds, left for 4-5 minutes and then be rinsed off with water. These treatments give 40-60 % germination in 6-30 days. Mechanical scarification is reported to yield 95% germination within 8 days of sowing. 

Promising new vegetative propagation methods include cuttings, grafting and multiplication by root fragments.
The plant's spreading root system offers excellent protection to the banks of watercourses.
 During the dry season, people eat the seeds.
Fodder: The leaves and pods are palatable to domestic animals and an important source of protein for livestock in the dry season.
Apiculture: For bee-keepers, it has the advantage of producing flowers at the end of the rains while most of the sahelian species flower just before or during the rains. It therefore becomes the main source of pollen and nectar at this time.
The plant stems are used as fuelwood. The calorific value is estimated at 19.741 kJ/kg of dry wood. Charcoal yields are as low as 17%.
Timber: The heartwood (specific gravity 0.56-0.71) is pale and creamy, brown sapwood slightly paler than the heartwood. The wood is susceptible to staining fungi and pinhole borer when green; therefore, it is left to soak for several months to remove sap and minimize attack by fungi, borers and termites. Even after the most careful seasoning, the boards tend to spring and twist one or two hours after they are sawn. The wood works fairly easily by hand, but a smooth finish is difficult to obtain. Care must be taken when nailing, bolting and joining. It is used to make utensils, canoes, furniture, boxes, drums and oil presses.
 Shade or shelter: F. albida is maintained and protected on farms to shade coffee and to provide shade for livestock in the dry season.
Medicine: The use of bark and roots either externally or internally against respiratory infections, digestive disorders, malaria and other fevers is widespread. The bark is used to clean teeth, as it is believed to contain fluorine; an extract is used for toothache in humans and eye infections in livestock.
Ornamental: A useful ornamental tree for gardens and avenues.
Branches lopped for fencing compounds and livestock enclosures.
Soil improver: F. albida sheds its leaves in the rainy season; therefore, boosting the nutrient status of the soil for the new season’s crops. The fact that the tree is leafless during the rainy season minimizes competition for sunlight with crops and protects them from birds until harvest time. Recommended for integration with maize as an alternative to Leucaena leucocephala."
Faurea saligna,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (Transvaalboekenhout,rooiboekenhout,witboekenhout,bosveldboekenhout,geelboekenhout), Bemba (saninga), English (beachwood,red boekenhout,beechwood,African beech), Lozi (musokoto), Lunda (musokoto), Ndebele (umdwadwa), Nyanja (chiyele,chinsense),
Faurea saligna is usually a small- to medium-sized, slender, graceful, semi-deciduous tree, 7-10 (max. 20) m in height; stem straight or twisted, sometimes swollen at the base, with a diameter of nearly 60 cm. Bark dark greyish-brown to almost black, rough and deeply fissured longitudinally. A spreading, fairly sparse crown develops with age, young branchlets pendent and conspicuously red.

Leaves leathery, long, pointed, narrow, alternate, simple, 6.5-16 x 1.3-2.5 cm, droop downwards gracefully, sometimes somewhat sickle shaped, shiny, fresh green to yellowish-green, turning red in autumn, young leaves pink to bright rosy red, tapering to the base and apex; margin entire, wavy, slightly curved; petiole up to 2 cm long, pink; main vein red, side veins join up to form a long vein just within the margin. Flowers in slender spikes, 12-15 x 2-3 cm, greenish to creamy white during the flowering stage, mauve or pinkish-white in the fruiting stage, honey scented, stalkless; calyx red and hairy.

Fruit a small nutlet, club shaped, brown, with long silky white or yellow hairs, containing a single spherical, hairy seed and slender, persistent, red styles which appear as woolly pinkish-white spikes.

A 1st field impression is that the tree resembles Rhus lancea, but closer inspection reveals the absence of the 3-foliate leaf typical of the latter. The name beechwood arises because the wood resembles that of the European beech. 

The generic name, Faurea, was given as a tribute to the memory of a young soldier and ardent botanist, W.C. Faure; the specific name, saligna, is Latin and means ‘willow’ or ‘willow-like’ and refers to the drooping willow-like leaves and catkins.
Ecology

F. saligna occurs at low-medium altitudes in open woodland and on stony hillsides, sometimes along river banks. In South Africa, its presence is associated with sourveld, turpentine grass and tamboekie grass, and  reportedly can withstand moderate burning, but doesl not survive fierce grass fires. F. saligna is a common and graceful tree of the Transvaal bushveld and lowveld, where it grows in clumps or together in large numbers. In Zimbabwe, it is frequent in woodlands on the central watershed and in escarpment woodland. It is widespread in highland savannah in Kenya, particularly around Mt Kenya, and is found in low- to high-altitude forest as far west as Nigeria. This species of early forest successions is common at the edges of the Impenetrable (Bwindi) Forest and of forests on Ruwenzori and Mufumbiro Mountains in Uganda. The typical form of F. saligna is found throughout Zambia with the exception of Western Province and Kalombo District; here, it is essentially a woodland tree restricted to miombo, Kalahari, and chipya woodland where it is occasional to locally frequent, especially in plateau miombo. There is another variety of this species with broader, glossier leaves, which is confined to the higher rainfall areas of Zambia and  essentially a riparian tree of gallery forest, rarely found in miombo woodland.

These trees are not easy to grow; seeds should be sown fresh for best results; artificial regeneration is also carried out, using seedlings and wildings.
Apiculture:  Flowers produce nectar that is readily collected by honey bees. Honey dark coloured, of high viscosity, granulates slowly and is strongly flavoured. The aroma is rather musty.
Wood makes good firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  The wood is strong, durable, of medium weight, brittle, and pale yellow, red or dark brown. It is beautifully figured, handsomely coarse grained, polishes well, does not warp or shrink and can be worked green, but suffers from gum pockets (cracks in the wood filled with bright yellow gum). It is easy to work and excellent for furniture, cabinet making, internal construction, joinery, doors, wagons, poles, posts, water wheels, panelling and as general-purpose timber. It is not attacked by borers or termites.
Tannin or dyestuff: A red dye is obtained by soaking the wood in water, and the bark can be used for tanning leather.
Medicine: The bark is boiled in broth and taken as a tonic, while roots are boiled and the liquid drunk as a remedy for diarrhoea and indigestion.
Ornamental: It is an attractive tree, suitable for planting in amenity areas.
Trees can be planted as windbreaks.
Intercropping: The species is often left standing in cropland."
Feijoa sellowiana,"Local names:
 English (guavasteen,New Zealand banana,horn of plenty,Brazilian guava,fig guava,pineapple guava), German (fejoa,ananasguave), Portuguese (feijoa,goiaba abacaxí,goiaba verde,goiaba serrana), Spanish (guayaba pina,guayabo chico,guayabo del pais,guayabo gra
Feijoa sellowiana is a shrub or small tree, 3-6 m in height and very branchy. Trunk cylindrical, peeling off in small pieces. Bark pale grey; branches spreading, swollen at the nodes, white-hairy when young.

Leaves evergreen, thick, leathery, opposite, short petioled, bluntly elliptical; 2-6 cm long and 1-3 cm wide; smooth, glossy on upper surface and finely veined, silvery underneath.

Flowers conspicuous, 4 cm wide, bisexual, borne singly or in cluster, stamens long, erect purple or bright red, topped with large, round, yellow anthers; petals 4, oval, fleshy; white tinged with purple on the inside, 1-2 cm long; sepals 4, persistent.

Fruits 5-8 cm long, 3-7 cm in diameter; variable in shape from round to elongated pear shape, with the persistent calyx segments adhering to the apex. Skin waxy, dull blue-green to blue or greyish green, sometimes with a red or orange blush; texture varies from smooth to rough and pebbly. Flesh thick, white, granular, watery; central pulp translucent, enclosing the seeds; sweet or subacid, suggesting a combination of pineapple and guava or pineapple and strawberry flavor, often with overtones of winter green or spearmint. The fruit emits a strong long-lasting perfume, even before it is fully ripe. 

There are usually 20-40, occasionally as many as 100, very small, oblong seeds hardly noticeable when the fruit is eaten.

It is the best known of the 3 species in the genus which the German botanist, Ernst Berger, named after Don da Silva Feijoa, a botanist of San Sebastian, Spain. The specific name honors F. Sellow, a German who collected specimens in the province of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.
Ecology

The feijoa needs a subtropical climate with low humidity. The plant thrives where the weather is cool part of the year and it can withstand temperatures as low as -11.11ºC. It is drought-resistant but needs adequate water for fruit production. The feijoa can tolerate partial shade and slight exposure to salt spray.

The species is widely distributed in the southern part of South America, from lat. 26°S in southern Paraná in Brazil, to lat. 35°S in Uruguay, including northeastern Argentina and southern-central Paraguay. In Brazil there are still wild populations in forests (gallery) and deforested areas on sites at altitudes over 500 m. At these sites, the summer is hot and rainy and the winter reaches temperatures of 0 to 8°C, sometimes dropping to -4°C.
Native range
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay
Tree management

When 60 to 80 cm in height, they are transplanted at a distance of 6 x 3 m or 6 x 2 m, which will give 550 to 850 saplings per hectare. With an average production of 1000 fruits per adult tree and fruits weighing 30 to 60 g, these densities produce yields ranging from 16 to 50 tonnes per hectare. Feijoas respond well to pruning and can easily be shaped to any desired form. The shrubs may be set 1.5 m apart to form a barrier hedge; 1 m apart in a compact foundation planting.

The feijoa requires little care beyond good soil preparation before planting. Subsequent cultivation is inadvisable because of the plant's shallow, fibrous root system which should be left undisturbed. If planted for its fruit, fertilizer should be low in nitrogen to avoid excessive vegetative growth.
Thinning permits easier harvesting. When grown as a hedge, the feijoa responds well to heavy pruning or shearing, but this reduces flower and fruit production.
Seeds are recalcitrant. They are separated by squeezing the seedy pulp into a container, covering with water, and letting the liquid stand for 4 days to ferment. The seeds are then strained out and dried before sowing. The seeds will retain viability for a year or more if kept dry. Germination takes place in 3 weeks.

At these sites, the summer is hot and rainy and the winter reaches temperatures of 0 to 8°C, sometimes dropping to -4°C.
Feijoas are propagated from seed, layering, cutting and grafting. Propagation from seed produces very heterogeneous plants. Consequently, this method is used only in the production of rootstock and in small domestic gardens. Seeds are sown fresh, either in seedbeds, using the conventional technique, or directly into 30 x 20 cm polyethylene bags. They are transplanted into the nursery at a distance of 1 x 0.40 m until they reach a height of 60 to 80 cm, or are grafted with selected varieties. Soil should be sterilized to avoid damping-off. The young plants are transplanted to pots when they have produced their second leaves.
Erosion control:  The shallow root system holds soil and prevents erosion.
  The fresh fruit is widely consumed because of its characteristic flavour and aroma, which are similar to pineapple. The fleshy petals of its beautiful flowers are also appreciated. In addition, there is a wide variety of industrialized products on the market in the form of paste, jam, crystallized fruits, preserves in syrup and liqueur. The flesh can be used in the soft drinks and ice-cream industries.
Timber:  The wood is dense, hard and brittle.
Shade or shelter:  Feijoa is planted as a windbreak around wind-sensitive crops.
Ornamental:  The foliage is attractive at all seasons and is planted as an ornamental. They also make an excellent foundation planting, either singly or as an informal hedge.
When planted close together, the shrubs make a nice hedge, screen, or windbreak."

The wood-apple is native and common in dry plains. It prefers a monsoon climate with a distinct dry season. The tree grows up to an elevation of 450 m in the western Himalayas.
The wood-apple is generally grown from seeds. Multiplication may also be by root cuttings, air-layers, or by budding onto self-seedlings to induce dwarfing and precociousness.
  The rind must be cracked with a hammer. The scooped-out sticky pulp, is eaten raw with or without sugar, or is blended with coconut milk and palm-sugar syrup and drunk as a beverage, or frozen as an ice cream. It is also used in chutneys and for making jelly and jam. The pulp represents 36% of the whole fruit. The pectin content of the pulp is 3-5% (16% yield on dry-weight basis) and has potential for multiple uses. Seeds contain bland, non-bitter, oil high in unsaturated fatty acids.
The tree is lopped for fodder.
The wood serves as fuel.
Timber:  Wood is yellow-grey or whitish, hard, heavy, durable, and valued for construction, pattern-making, agricultural implements, rollers for mills, carving, rulers, and other products. 
Medicine: The fruit is used in India as a liver and cardiac tonic, and when unripe, as an astringent means of halting diarrhoea and dysentery and effective treatment for hiccough, sore throat and diseases of the gums. The pulp is poulticed onto bites and stings of venomous insects, as is the powdered rind.  Juice of young leaves is mixed with milk and sugar candy and given as a remedy for biliousness and intestinal troubles of children. The powdered gum, mixed with honey, is given to overcome dysentery and diarrhea in children.  Oil derived from the crushed leaves is applied on itch and the leaf decoction is given to children as an aid to digestion. Leaves, bark, roots and fruit pulp are all used against snakebite. The spines are crushed with those of other trees and an infusion taken as a remedy for menorrhagia. The bark is chewed with that of Barringtonia and applied on venomous wounds. 
Gum or resin:  The trunk and branches exude a white, transparent gum; especially following the rainy season utilized as a substitute for, or adulterant of gum arabic, and also in making artists' watercolors, ink, dyes and varnish. It consists of 35.5% ara

Flowers in clusters of 4-20, are usually red, but some trees have yellow ones. Petals normally 4, each about 12 mm wide 11 mm long; anthers attached to a pistillode with a non-functional stigma. Female flowers occur singly or in clusters of up to 4. The stigmatic surface is normally enlarged, and there is no style. Pistillate flowers have rudimentary and non-functional staminodes. Neither male nor female flowers produce nectar.

Fruit a green, ovoid berry, 5 cm in diameter, yellow or red when ripe, with 6-8 grooves. 

Seed 6-8, smooth, large, about 5 cm long and 2 cm wide surrounded by a succulent aril.
Ecology

It is found in semi-evergreen to evergreen forests. In India, it is commonly found in the evergreen and shola forests of Western Ghats, Karnataka and Kerala. The tree is very much adapted to both hilltops and plain lands, but its performance is best in riverbanks and valleys. It also grows well in dry or occasionally water logged or flooded soils.
Native range
India, Nepal, Sri Lanka
Tree management

Land preparation involves preparing 1 m2 pits 10 m apart. Refill the pits with a mixture of topsoil and compost / fertilizer. Proper care should be given to avoid water stagnation in pits. In India, planting is generally done during July-October months: The crop can be raised as a pure or as a perennial intercrop of coconut, arecanut gardens. Clean the field free of bushes and thick shades. Weed once in three months and mulch the basin with black polythene or dry leaves to avoid drying.

The percentage of male trees in population varies from 50-60 per cent and this also creates much difficulty in the cultivation of the crop. Problems such as lack of high yielder, planting grafts prepared from elite mother trees can solve variability in population and occurrence of male trees

Fertilizer application involves using 10 kg of cattle manure or compost per seedling/graft during the first year. This is increased gradually to 50 kg annually at15 years.
Seeds are collected manually from freshly harvested and fully ripened fruits before they fall. Immediately after harvesting, they are washed in running water to separate the fruit rind. The seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant. Viability can be maintained for 1-2 months in moist storage at 20°C.

The tree is very much adapted to both hilltops and plain lands, but its performance is best in riverbanks and valleys. It also grows well in dry or occasionally water logged or flooded soils.
Seeds, stem cuttings and grafts normally propagate G. gummi-gutta. In natural populations, seeds lie dormant for 8 months, coinciding with the period between the cessation and onset of annual rainfall.

Seeds are sown during the month of August-September. It takes 5-7 months for the seed to start germination. Seed treatment methods such as mechanical scarification or hormone treatments are employed to hasten germination. Seedlings can be kept under open condition or under shade. Regular irrigation on alternate days during summer months is necessary. The seedlings are ready for planting in 6-7 months and should start bearing fruits in 10-12 years

Softwood grafting and approach grafting are normally employed. Grafts start bearing in 3-4 years.
 The rinds of the ripe fruits are processed and used as a condiment in fish and prawn preparations to impart flavour and taste and to improve the keeping quality. In India, the dried seeds often yield a protein and fat-rich  butter, popularly known as uppage tuppa Fruit juice or syrup is used as a coolant and helps reduce body fat. Fruit rind is marketed in large quantities, for example in India, export of over 50 tonnes (valued at 17 million rupees) have been recorded
Timber: Its wood is used in construction and furniture making 
Shade or shelter: It’s a good shade tree for shade-loving crops such as ginger or in association with other field crops including medicinal plants
Lipids: Fat obtained from seed is used as vegetable butter.
Medicine: A decoction made from it is given for rheumatism and bowel complaints. In cattle, it is used as a wash for mouth diseases. An extract obtained from the mature fruit rind, Hydroxy Citric Acid, is used against obesity.
Ornamental: A good ornamental tree especially when mixed with other trees
Ideally suited for boundary planting on the farm field
Intercropping: The crop can be raised as a perennial intercrop with coconut and arecanut."
Garcinia hanburyi,"Local names:
 English (gamboge tree), German (Gutti,Gummigutt), Thai (rong), Vietnamese (dang hoang)
An evergreen, small to medium-sized tree, up to 15 m tall, with short and straight trunk, up to 20 cm in diameter; bark grey, smooth, 4-6 mm thick, exuding a yellow gum-resin.  

Leaves opposite, leathery, elliptic or ovate-lanceolate, 10-25 cm x 3-10 cm, cuneate at base, acuminate at apex, shortly stalked.

Flowers in clusters or solitary in the axils of fallen leaves, 4-merous, pale yellow and fragrant, unisexual or bisexual; male flowers somewhat smaller than female and bisexuals; sepals leathery, orbicular, 4-6 mm long, persistent; petals ovate, 6-7 mm long; stamens numerous and arranged on an elevated receptacle in male flowers, less numerous and reduced in female flowers; ovary superior, 4-loculed, with sessile stigma. 

Fruit a globose berry, 2-3 cm in diameter, smooth, with recurved sepals at the base and crowned by the persistent stigma, 1-4 seeded.

Seeds 15-20 mm long, surrounded by a pulpy aril.

The gum-resin from G. hanburyi is often called Siamese gamboge to distinguish it from the similar product from the bark of G. morella Desr., called Indian gamboge.  The species are closely related, and G. hanburyi has been considered in the past as a variety of G. morella.
Ecology

Gamboge tree occurs naturally in rain forest.
Native range
Cambodia, China, Sri Lanka
Tree management

Gamboge tree is not in cultivation; only wild trees are tapped.   Usually trees are not tapped before they are 20 years old, when the trunk has attained a diameter of about 15 cm.  A spiral incision is made in the trunk just below the lowest branches, and the exudate is collected in a bamboo container.  About every 3 days the content is poured into smaller bamboo stem parts (about 75 cm long), in which the gum-resin coagulates in about a month or longer. The bamboo containers are then cracked and the gamboge is removed in cylindrical sticks (pipe gamboge), which is the usual form in trade.  Sometimes gamboge is moulded and pressed into cakes.
 
Gamboge tree occurs naturally in rain forest.
 
Timber: The wood is pale or brownish-yellow, straight grained, with fine texture, and fairly heavy, weighing about 900 kg/m.  It is moderately hard and works easily; it takes a fine polish. The wood is sometimes used for interior work.
Medicine: Gamboge is a drastic purgative, an emetic, and a vermifuge for treating tape worm, but it is no longer used in human medicine.  Sometimes it is given to cows as purgative.
Gum or resin: The tree is valued because of the resinous sap, called gamboge, which exudes from incisions in the bark.  The reddish-yellow to brownish-orange sap contains 70-80% resin and 15-25% gum.  The main acidic component of the resin is cambogic aci"

Garcinia mangostana,"Local names:
 Burmese (mingut), Dutch (manggis,manggistan), English (mangostan,king's fruit,mangosteen), Filipino (mangis,mangostan), French (mangoustanier,mangostanier,mangouste,mangostier), German (Mangostanbaum), Indonesian (manggis), Lao (Sino-Tibetan) (mangkhut),
The mangosteen is a small, evergreen tree, very slow-growing, erect with a pyramidal crown; attains 6-25 m in height, has dark-brown or nearly black, flaking bark, the inner bark containing yellow, gummy, bitter latex.

Leaves opposite, short-stalked, ovate-oblong or elliptic, leathery and thick, dark-green, slightly glossy above, yellowish-green and dull beneath; 9-25 cm long, 4.5-10 cm wide, with conspicuous, pale midrib. New leaves rosy.

Flowers 4-5 cm wide, fleshy, may be male or hermaphrodite on the same tree. The former are in clusters of 3-9 at the branch tips; there are 4 sepals and 4 ovate, thick, fleshy petals, green with red spots on the outside, yellowish-red inside. Stamens many, fertile and sterile. The hermaphrodite are borne singly or in pairs at the tips of young branchlets; their petals may be yellowish-green edged with red or mostly red, and are quickly shed. 

Fruit a subglobose berry, capped by the prominent calyx at the stem end, with 4-8 triangular, flat remnants of the stigma in a rosette at the apex, dark-purple to red-purple and smooth externally, 3.4-7.5 cm in diameter. The rind is 6-10 mm thick, red in cross-section, purplish-white on the inside; contains bitter yellow latex and a purple staining juice. There are 4-8 triangular segments of snow-white, juicy, soft flesh (actually the arils of the seeds).

The fruit may be seedless or have 1-5 fully developed seeds. Seed ovoid-oblong, somewhat flattened, 2.5 cm long and 1.6 cm wide that cling to the flesh. Flesh slightly acid, mild to distinctly acid in flavor, acclaimed to be exquisitely luscious and delicious.

The generic name is after L. Garcin (1683-1751), a naturalist and a correspondent of Linnaeus.
Ecology

The mangosteen is ultra-tropical. It cannot tolerate temperatures below 4 deg C, nor above 38 deg C. It is limited in Malaysia to elevations below 450 m. In Madras it grows from 76-1 500 m above sea-level. It ordinarily requires high atmospheric humidity and an annual rainfall of at least 1 270 mm, and no long periods of drought. The tree needs good drainage and the water table ought to be about 1.8 m below ground level. The mangosteen must be sheltered from strong winds and salt spray, as well as saline soil or water.
Native range
Indonesia, Malaysia
Tree management

A spacing of 10.7-12 m is recommended. Planting is preferably done at the beginning of the rainy season. Pits 1.2 x l.2 x l.3 m are prepared at least 30 days in advance, enriched with organic matter and topsoil and left to weather. The young tree is put in place very carefully to avoid root injury and given a heavy watering. Partial shading with palm fronds or other means should be maintained for 3-5 years. Indian growers give each tree regular feeding with well-rotted manure, (45-90 kg) and peanut meal (4.5-6.8 kg) total, per year.

Some of the most fruitful mangosteen trees grow on the banks of streams, lakes, ponds or canals where the roots are almost constantly wet. However, dry weather just before blooming time and during flowering induces a good fruit-set. Where a moist planting site is not available, irrigation ditches should be dug to make it possible to maintain an adequate water supply and the trees are irrigated almost daily during the dry season.

In Malaysia and Sri Lanka, it is a common practice to spread mulch of coconut husks or fronds to retain moisture. It has been suggested that small inner branches be pruned from old, unproductive trees to stimulate bearing. Cropping is irregular and the yield varies from tree to tree and from season to season ranging from 6 years in Central America to 12-20 years in Thailand. The first crop may be 200-300 fruits. Average yield of a full-grown tree is about 500 fruits. The yield steadily increases up to the 30th year of bearing when crops of 1 000-2 000 fruits may be obtained. In Madras, individual trees between the ages of 20-45 years have borne 2 000-3 000 fruits. Productivity gradually declines thereafter, though the tree will still be fruiting at 100 years of age.
Seeds are recalcitrant and should be stored in their fruit at room temperature, or in moist peat moss, even these will lose viability in 5 days after removal from the fruit, though they are viable for 3-5 weeks in the fruit. Viability can be maintained for 1-2 months in moist storage at 20 deg C, storage temperature of 10 deg C is damaging. Seeds packed in lightly dampened peat moss, sphagnum moss or coconut fiber in airtight containers have remained viable for 3 months. Only 22% germination has been realized in seeds packed in ground charcoal for 15 days. Soaking in water for 24 hours expedites and enhances the rate of germination. Generally, sprouting occurs in 20 to 22 days and is complete in 43 days.
The mangosteen is ultra-tropical. It cannot tolerate temperatures below 4 deg C, nor above 38 deg C. It is limited in Malaysia to elevations below 450 m. In Madras it grows from 76-1 500 m above sea-level. It ordinarily requires high atmospheric humidity and an annual rainfall of at least 1 270 mm, and no long periods of drought. The tree needs good drainage and the water table ought to be about 1.8 m below ground level. The mangosteen must be sheltered from strong winds and salt spray, as well as saline soil or water.
Technically, the so-called ""seeds"" are not true seeds but adventitious embryos, or hypocotyl tubercles; there has been no sexual fertilization. When growth begins, a shoot emerges from one end of the seed and a root from the other end. But this root is short-lived and is replaced by roots which develop at the base of the shoot. The process of reproduction being vegetative, there is naturally little variation in the resulting trees and their fruits. Some of the seeds are polyembryonic, producing more than one shoot. The individual nucellar embryos can be separated, if desired, before planting. The percentage of germination is directly related to the weight of the seed, only plump, fully developed seeds should be chosen for planting.

Because of the long, delicate taproot and poor lateral root development, transplanting is notoriously difficult. It must not be attempted after the plants reach 60 cm. At that time the depth of the taproot may exceed the height. There is greater seedling survival if seeds are planted directly in the nursery row than if first grown in containers and then transplanted to the nursery. The nursery soil should be 1 m deep, at least. The young plants take 2 years or more to reach a height of 30 cm, when they can be taken up with a deep ball of earth and set out.
Poison:  The fruit hulls show anti-fungal and anti-protozal activity.
 The best table fruits are those with the highest number of stigma lobes at the apex, for these have the highest number of fleshy segments and the fewest seeds. The numbers always correspond. Mangosteens are usually eaten fresh as dessert. The fleshy segments are sometimes canned, but they are said to lose their delicate flavor in canning, especially if pasteurized for as much as 10 minutes. Tests have shown that it is best to use a 40% syrup and sterilize for only 5 minutes. The more acid fruits are best for preserving. To make jam, in Malaysia, seedless segments are boiled with an equal amount of sugar and a few cloves for 15-20 minutes and then put into glass jars. In the Philippines, a preserve is made by boiling the segments in brown sugar, and the seeds may be included to enrich the flavour. The seeds are sometimes eaten alone after boiling or roasting. The rind is rich in pectin. After treatment with 6% sodium chloride to eliminate astringency, the rind is made into a purplish jelly.
Timber: In Thailand, all non-bearing trees are felled, so the wood is available but usually only in small dimensions. It is dark-brown, heavy, almost sinks in water, and is moderately durable. It has been used in construction and cabinetwork, to make handles for spears and rice pounders.
Tannin or dyestuff: The fruit rind contains 7-14% catechin tannin and rosin, and is used for tanning leather in China. It also yields a black dye.
Medicine: The sliced and dried rind is powdered and administered to overcome dysentery. Made into an ointment, it is applied on eczema and other skin disorders. The rind decoction is taken to relieve diarrhoea and cystitis, gonorrhoea and gleet and is applied externally as an astringent lotion. A portion of the rind is steeped in water overnight and the infusion given as a remedy for chronic diarrhoea in adults and children. Filipinos employ a decoction of the leaves and bark as a febrifuge and to treat thrush, diarrhoea, dysentery and urinary disorders. In Malaysia, an infusion of the leaves, combined with unripe banana and a little benzoin is applied to the circumcision wound. A root decoction is taken to regulate menstruation. A bark extract called ""amibiasine"", has been marketed for the treatment of amoebic dysentery"

G. quaesita is usually propagated by seeds and vegetatively by grafting. This species spreads in the natural forests by natural regeneration. Germination in the nursery is very poor. Freshly harvested seeds require about 13 months to germinate. Seed pretreatment by coat removal (decoating) or application of giberellic acid (GA3) before sowing increases the germination rate and time

In India, vegetative propagation through grafting on to G. tinctoria rootstocks (originally grown from seeds) have been carried out. It was observed that the success rate increased with increasing age of the rootstock. There is greater seedling survival if seeds are planted directly into the nursery row than if first grown in containers and then transplanted to the nursery. The young plants take 2 years or more to reach a height of 30 cm, at which time they can be transplanted into the field.
Erosion control: When intercropped with other crops home-gardens, it holds together soil thus controlling soil erosion
 The edible fruits have a distinctive sweet acid taste. Dried fruits of are widely used as a spice in the preparation of fish curries. The dried rind is a condiment especially in Sri Lanka, India and Malabar. It is used as a metabolic regulator (against obesity).
Timber: The grey, close-grained wood produces a non-durable of low quality (600-700 kg/m3). The heartwood is distinctly hard and durable in old trees. The wood is used for posts, matchboxes and splits while the timber is used in cheap boxes
Shade or shelter: It can be a good shade plant
Lipids: The seeds have very high oil content. They contain up to about 31% of edible fat, rich in oleic acid
Medicine: The fruit rind and extracts of Garcinia are used in traditional medicinal recipes especially in the Ayurvedic system. Leaves are astringent and anti-pyretic. A decoction of the fruit rind is taken for rheumatism and bowel complaints. It is used as a decoction for washing ulcers and a gargle in weak and spongy gums. Internally, it acts as a stomachic and is used in anorexia and chronic dyspepsia. In veterinary medicine, it has been used as a rinse for diseases of the mouth in cattle
Gum or resin: The tree yields a translucent yellow resin, which does not form an emulsion with water. The latex is soluble in turpentine and gives a yellow varnish, used in painting and dyeing
Ornamental: It is a good ornamental tree when planted along road avenues
Latex or rubber: The dried rind used for polishing gold and silver, is a substitute for acetic and formic acids in the coagulation of rubber latex"

Genipa americana is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, 8-20 m tall, occasionally up to 30 m, and a diameter of 30-80 cm. Trunk is usually tall and straight, crown dense and the lower branches more or less horizontal. The bark is thick and smooth.

Leaves simple, opposite, oblong-obovate, 10-35 cm long by 4-13 cm wide, short-petioled, sometimes faintly toothed, with prominent whitish midrib, clustered at the end of the branches. For each pair of leaves there are two stipules that often leave very distinct scars on falling off.

The Bisexual flowers are small (4cm wide), faintly fragrant, yellow-white, tubular and 5-petalled. They are borne in short, branched, terminal inflorescences.

Fruit a large berry, elliptic or rounded-oval, tapering briefly at the stem end. Measuring 9-15 cm long by 7-9 cm wide, each fruit weighs 200-400 g. Each fruit has a thin leathery skin and a soft yellow-brown mesocarp 1-2 cm thick. There are up to 300 seeds/fruit 
Seed hard, flat, dark brown, 10-12 mm long, covered with the fibrous inner mesocarp.
Ecology

The genipap is native to wet or moist areas and is widely distributed throughout the humid tropical and parts of subtropical Americas. It is found especially in the 'várzeas' the part of the Amazon forest, which lies next to rivers and is flooded annually for several months. It  also extends into the open forest/savannah transition zone. In most places it is restricted to the lowlands. It is common in secondary forests on sites abandoned by shifting agriculture. Although reasonably represented in these vegetation types, its presence is rather scattered except where planted. It tolerates dry periods of up to 6 months but is sensitive to near zero temperatures

Tree management

For fruit production, spacing of 10 x 15 m is normally used and for the purposes of reforestation spacing may be 1.5 m x 3 m or up to 3 m x 3 m especially for timber production. The tree requires little cultural attention. Temporary crops such as cassava or cotton can be inter-planted to provide shade for the young trees
Mature fruits fall to the ground. Collecting fruits directly from the tree is done when the colour changes to greenish grey. A tree of 15-20 years can produce 400-600 fruits

The freshly harvested fruits are packed in bags that allow for ventilation and protection from direct sunlight. At the processing site, the fruits are soaked in water and macerated in order to remove the pulp. The extracted seeds are spread out on mesh wire and left to dry in the shade in a well-ventilated place because of the high moisture content. At the time of harvest, the seeds have moisture content of almost 50% (this value is for seeds extracted without using water), which should be dried to below some 15%. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. There are 10000 seeds/kg.

Propagation is usually by seeds, cuttings and grafting. Seed pretreatment is not necessary but soaking the seeds in running water for 1-2 days accelerates germination. Germination begins after 1-2 weeks and is complete after 1 month. If sown in seedbeds, seedlings are ready for pricking out 20 days after germination. Initial growth is slow; it takes about one year to attain transplanting size of 20-40 cm. Because of drought sensitivity the best way of establishment is to use containerized seedlings. Vegetative propagation by grafting is used for varieties with superior fruit quality.
 The species is mainly grown for its fruits, a popular source of beverages. The pulp from mature fruits is cooked with sugar to produce syrup used for various beverages and deserts. It is a common practice in Puerto Rico to cut up the fruits, steep them in water until there is a little fermentation and then add flavoring and drink. As an edible fruit, it is rated low. The values for the edible portion (70%) of the fruit contains about 0.51% proteins, 11.21% carbohydrates, 4.30% sugar and 0.63%.malic acid.
Fodder: Cattle readily eat the foliage. The fallen, astringent fruits are much eaten by wild and domestic animals
Apiculture: The flowers yield nectar for honeybees
Saplings good for firewood
Fibre: It yields a fiber employed in making rough clothing
Timber: The wood is yellowish-white or sometimes slightly pinkish or lavender, with light, reddish-brown streaks. It is of good quality with fine grain and easy to work. It is used for cabinets, carvings, light construction and many other minor uses. It is neither durable nor resistant to termites, borers and fungi. Saplings are usually harvested at 5-6 years old for poles or fence posts
Shade or shelter: It is widely planted for its shade.
Tannin or dyestuffs: The bark is rich in tannins, used for treating leather. A dark blue body paint is made from the green fruits, which has been commonly employed by South American Indians to paint their faces and bodies for adornment, to repel insects, to dye clothing, hammocks, utensils and basket materials. The dye is indelible on the skin for 15 to 20 days. This was a very common use and probably the reason for the wide distribution of the species
Medicine: In El Salvador, the fruit is eaten as a remedy for jaundice and when eaten in large quantities, acts as a vermifuge. The fruit juice is given as a diuretic while the fruit infusion as a cold remedy. The crushed green fruit and the bark decoction are applied on venereal sores and pharyngitis. The root decoction is a strong purgative. The bark exudes a whitish, sweetish gum when cut. This is diluted and used as an eyewash and is claimed to alleviate corneal opacities. The flower decoction and juice from the leaves is commonly given as a tonic and febrifuge. The pulverized seeds are emetic and caustic. The identification of 2 antibiotic cyclopentoid monoterpenes, primarily genipic acid and secondarily genipinic acid, its carbomethoxyl derivative, has been isolated from all parts of the fruit in Puerto Rico.
Ornamental: It is a popular ornamental tree in homegardens
In Trinidad, the tree is occasionally planted as a live-hedge in grazing areas.
Soil improver: The heavy leaf fall of the genipap is important in improving the soils 
Intercropping: It can be interplanted with temporary crops such as cassava or cotton to provide shade for the young trees"

Tree management

The tree requires protection from strong winds due to the weight of foliage. G. avellana shows a 2-year rhythm in seed production which is concentrated in summer and autumn. Spacing of 2-4 m x 2-4 m has been used in trials in Chile. The tree does better on sunny slopes, it coppices well.
G. avellana is an understorey tree common in the Valdivian forests of southern Chile. These diverse subantarctic forests show many Gondwana affinities. It grows from the snowline of the Pacific slopes of the Andes to the coast in areas that have Mediterranean (mild moist temperate maritime) climate with occasional radiation freezes in spring and autumn, as well as winter frosts. The habitats are open areas where forest vegetation regenerates spontaneously and Proteaceae are important in the secondary communities.
Gevuina is easily propagated from seed or cuttings. Sowing should be in early autumn, without pretreatment, in normal substrate. Survival can be enhanced by germination under sterile conditions or treatment of cuttings with 80 % fosetyl-aluminium at 5 g/l at 28 days intervals. In an experiment using in vitro techniques, germination started 7 days after sowing and was complete in 32 days, with 92% germination.  The tree roots easily but is difficult to establish due to the weak root system making it extremely sensitive to transplanting outside its native habitat.
It is a pioneer species tolerating situations occasioned by sun, wind and frost; qualities which can be exploited for reclaiming sites where top soil has been destroyed.
Erosion control:  The tree is found on badly eroded slopes and has potential for erosion control by binding soil liable to erosion.
  The fruit pulp and kernel are edible. The kernel is similar to hazelnut (Corylus avellana) in appearance and flavour and is eaten fresh or roasted. The protein concentration after oil extraction has been found to be 16 %. Of the 18 amino acids found in the flour, glutamic acid, followed by aspartic acid and arginine, are present in the greatest concentrations; lysine is the only limiting essential amino acid when compared with the FAO/WHO standards. Coupled with its low fat and high fibre content, gevuina flour has prospects as a health food. The whole nut is processed into a gevuina butter paste of high nutritional value, which can be at par with peanut butter.
Fodder: The high protein content of cracking residue is used as stock feed.
Apiculture:  Flowers have abundant nectar and are excellent bee fodder.
Timber:  The timber is pale brown with an attractive grain, light, strong, durable and easy to work. It is used in its native range for turnery, musical instruments, picture frames, furniture and shingles.
Tannin or dyestuff: Husks left over after nuts processing are rich in tannin.
Lipids:  Lipid content is comparable to rapeseed, sunflower and peanuts. The oil is of high quality as table oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linolenic and ecosaenoic. G. avellana nuts are rich in oils that have health-cosmetic purposes. The oil is particularly high in palmitoleic acid (up to 27.6 %), which is a good natural UV filter for sun lotions.
Ornamental:  Gevuina is an attractive garden and park specimen with showy sprays of creamy flowers contrasting vividly with the dark green foliage and bright red nuts."
Ginkgo biloba,"Local names:
 Chinese (ya-chiao,ginkyo,ginnan,pakgor su,paikua su,yinxing,gong sun shu,icho,fozhijia), Dutch (Japanse notenboom,waaierboom,tempelboom,ginkgo), English (ginkgo,Kew tree,golden fossil tree,maiden-hair tree), French (arbre des pagodes,arbre de Gordon,noye
Ginkgo biloba belongs to single plant division Ginkgopsida which consists of the single order Ginkgoales, a single family Ginkgoaceae and a single extant genus Ginkgo. The tree is deciduous reaching a height of 4 m, with a reddish bark. Male specimens show an upright and irregular form, female trees are low and spreading. 

Leaves fan-shaped glossy green (resembling those of the maidenhair fern or Adiantum), with irregularly toothed upper margins. Numerously veined, with a split in the middle and therefore appears to have two lobes. The leaves turn golden yellow before they fall.

The flowers are rather inconspicuous and grow on short spurs.Trees flower after 20-35 years, females exhibiting an abundance of ovules in pairs on stalks each containing an egg cell, initially very green, but later turning greenish-yellow, then orange and brown. The male flowers are yellow catkin-like pollen cones (microsporangia), 3-6 on each short shoot in the spring. 

A single naked ovule ripens into a drupe-like seed with an acrid, ill-smelling fleshy outer layer and a thin, smooth, horny inner layer. The fleshy-coated seeds silvery are frequently incorrectly designated as fruits or nuts. 

The generic name Ginkgo comes from the Chinese (later also Japanese) word ginkyo meaning 'silver apricot'. The specific name biloba means two-lobed: bi from the Latin 'bis' meaning double and 'loba' meaning leaf, which is an obvious reference to the fan-shaped leaves which have a split in the middle.
Ecology

Ginkgo is a hardy tree tolerating a variety of climate and soil types. It does not tolerate extreme frost.

Tree management

Generally the tree is very adaptable, tolerating all climates and soils. The tree takes 30 years to reach a height of 10 metres. Application of pollen by spraying was found to be the best method for increasing fruits quantity and quality. For ornamental gardens it is advisable to plant male trees only, because the female trees produce malodorous fruits.
Removal of the sarcotesta significantly increases the total germination. In one study cold stratification, an unnecessary treatment, improved seed germination percentage.
Ginkgo is a hardy tree tolerating a variety of climate and soil types. It does not tolerate extreme frost.
Ginkgo is propagated by direct seeding, soft wood cuttings or grafting to avoid female specimens. Germination begins 33 days after planting in a warm place, if planted in cold soil, germination is deferred until the soil warms in the spring. The seeds may be grown in gallon pots for a year or two before transplanting seedlings to their permanent location in the garden or landscape. The results of grafting experiments of G. biloba Gui 86-1 indicate that February-March and September-November are suitable periods for grafting. The highest grafting survival rates with 2-year seedling stock and current growing scion were 98% and 93% respectively. Treatment of 2-25 cm long cuttings of G. biloba with crystalline KMnO4 results in higher rooting rates compared with treatment of the same species with growth regulator powders (IBA & IAA).
Poison:  4'-O-Methylpyridoxine (ginkgotoxin) is a neurotoxic antivitamin B6 which occurs in G. biloba seeds and leaves. However, toxin amount is likely to be too low to exert detrimental effects after administration of the medication or ingestion of food. Leaf extracts of G. biloba are shown to be highly effective against the rice pest Nilaparvata lugens resistant to diazinon, carbofuran and fenobucarb (Kwon-Min et al. 1996). Extracts of powdered dried leaves were deterrent to P. brassicae and P. rapae at levels as low as 25-50 p.p.m.
This tree is hardy, surviving polluted environments remarkably. Ginkgo is a suitable tree for urban forestry.
  Various foods and drinks are made from the fruits, seeds and leaves. The seeds may be roasted and are considered a great delicacy. Seeds are high in starch, but low in protein and oil.
Shade or shelter:  The maidenhair tree is an excellent shade tree.
Medicine:  In Traditional Chinese Medicine the seeds (used as an astringent for the lung, to stop asthma, enuresis, and excessive leucorrhea and regulate urinary frequency) are considered more important than the leaves. However, in the west ginkgo leaves are exalted. The leaves of ginkgo, known in Chinese medicine as bai-guo-ye are first mentioned in Lan Mao's Dian Nan Ben Cao (Pharmaceutical Natural History of Southern Yunnan), published in 1436 during the Ming dynasty, are used externally to treat skin and head sores as well as freckles. Internal use of the leaves is noted in an imperial commissioned work recorded in 1505 for the treatment of diarrhoea. Over 300 scientific studies on the chemistry, pharmacology and clinical effects of gingko leaf have been conducted by European researchers over the last 20-30 years. The experimental results indicate ginkgo leaf extracts have a wide range of biological effects. The most well-known use among Americans is the perceived ability of the products to improve short term memory. Ginkgo extracts have been widely used in Europe for a wide variety of clinical conditions including vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), treatment of poor circulation, heart disease, eye diseases, chronic cerebral insufficiency, accidents involving brain trauma, dementia, and various conditions associated with senility. Studies have shown that the constituents ginkgoic acid and ginnol inhibit certain bacteria and fungal infections. New uses for ginkgo leaf extracts are emerging as more is being learned, especially those involving circulatory problems such as erectile dysfunction and improved memory, blood circulation. Also marketed as Shun Tian capsules, containing gingko leaves and ginseng.
Nitrogen fixing:  G. biloba roots are colonized by the fungus Glomus epigaeum, forming vesicular arbiscular mycorrhiza.
Ornamental:  Ginkgo has been widely adopted as an ornamental tree in many European and American cities.
Soil improver:  Leaf litter of the maidenhair tree improves soil fertility.
Other services:  Ginkgo figures strongly in legend and lore of China, and has been lovingly adopted by most cultures in the temperate regions of earth."
Gleditsia triacanthos,"Local names:
 English (honey locust,thorny locust,thorn tree,sweet locust,black locust,kirgis honey locust,honey shuck,three-horned acacia,common honeylocust), French (carouge miel,févier épineux), German (Dreidornige Gledischie), Italian (gledischia,spino di Cristo,s
Gleditsia triacanthos attains a normal height of 15-25 (50) m and 0.5-1 (max. 1.8) m diameter. Trees have a short bole and open, narrow or spreading crown, bark reddish-brown to black, scaly, ridged, often covered in clusters of large, branched thorns. It has a strong taproot and a profusely branched root system.

Leaves deciduous, alternate, singly or doubly pinnately compound. Those singly compound form early on dwarf shoots or toward the base of the long shoots; bear 14-30 leaflets (no terminal leaflet) on a central stalk 15-20 cm long; preformed in buds. Those doubly compound bear 4-7 pairs of branches, each resembling a singly compound leaf; neoformed during the growing season. Leaflets 25-40 mm long, widest near the base; tip rounded, often with a small point; sometimes minutely toothed.

Flowers greenish-white, regular, small, about 5 mm across. The male and female flowers on the same tree, often on separate branches. Perfect flowers may also be present. Pollen flowers in many-flowered clusters (racemes) 5-7 cm long. Seed flowers in few-flowered clusters 7-9 cm long. 

Fruit 15-40 cm long pods, flat, curved, twisted, brownish; husk leathery; falling in winter without opening. Seeds beanlike; with a hard, impermeable seed coat; 0.5-1.5 cm long, dark brown, smooth.

The generic name, sometimes spelt Gleditschia, commemorates the German botanist Johan Gottlieb Gleditsch (1714-1786), professor and director of the Berlin Botanic Garden. The specific name ‘tricanthos’ means 3-thorned; from the Greek ‘treis’ (three) and ‘akantha’ (a spine).
Ecology

Within the natural range, a large amount of variation exists in both climate and soil conditions. G. triacanthos occurs naturally in humid and subhumid climate regions; it grows naturally to 760 m but has been planted from sea level to 1500 m in temperate latitudes and will grow above 2500 m in subtropical highlands. It is shade intolerant and will only become established in open spaces. G. triacanthos is resistant to both drought and salinity.
Native range
United States of America
Tree management

Male trees (about 10%) must be included in or adjacent to fodder orchards to ensure pollination of female trees. When established in working pastures, young trees need protection with plastic tree shelters or electric fencing. Appropriately managed, average annual pod production of 40 kg/tree appears feasible. Planting 75 trees/ha (excluding male trees) would yield 3000 kg/ha, sufficient to provide 100 sheep a 1.5-kg ration of pods for 20 days. The tree coppices vigorously when cut. Typical of many caesalpinioid genera, G. triacanthos does not nodulate and lacks the ability for symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen.
After harvest, pods should be stored at 0 deg. C to prevent fermentation. If bruchid seed weevils (Amblycerus robiniae) are present in the pods, it will prevent them from spreading within the pods. 

Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. A few seeds germinated after 50 years in storage at 4% mc and ambient temperature; viability was maintained for several years in hermetic air-dry storage at 0-8 deg. C. Seed yield averages 5200 seeds/kg (3300-14 300, depending on the seed source) with high purity and soundness.
Within the natural range, a large amount of variation exists in both climate and soil conditions. G. triacanthos occurs naturally in humid and subhumid climate regions; it grows naturally to 760 m but has been planted from sea level to 1500 m in temperate latitudes and will grow above 2500 m in subtropical highlands. It is shade intolerant and will only become established in open spaces. G. triacanthos is resistant to both drought and salinity.
Mature pods can be collected after they drop off, or by hitting branches to jar the pods loose, or by clipping pods from the branches. Successful germination requires seed scarification by immersion in concentrated sulphuric acid (60-120 minutes followed by thorough rinsing), hot water (82 deg. C), or by mechanical means. To prepare pods for mechanical seed extraction, place them in a convection or seed-drying oven for at least 2 hours at 35 deg. C. Germination of sound seed should be in the range of 75-95%. Seeds should be sown 0.5-1.5 cm deep and, if they are properly scarified, complete germination will occur within 21 days. Dormant, nursery-grown seedlings can be stored, bare rooted, at about 0 deg. C for several weeks before planting out.

For successful propagation of G. triacanthos, chip budding with green wood works best. Dormant scionwood results in a low percentage of successful grafts; 1-year-old seedlings (or budded/grafted material) can be out-planted the following spring. Due to large variation in pod production from different parent trees, and the presence of both male and female trees, only grafted seedlings are recommended for planting to secure consistently high production at an early age.
Poison: Triacanthine from the leaves is highly toxic (LD50 about 35 mg/kg) and of questionable oncostatic activity.
Erosion control: Because it can be applied in erosion control, G. triacanthos is being tested in many temperate, Mediterranean and highland tropic regions of the world.
 Seeds have been roasted and used as a coffee substitute.
Fodder: G. triacanthos leaves are an excellent source of fodder, contain 20% crude protein, low lignin and ensile well. Coppice regrowth retains high protein and low lignin levels. It has used as fodder in Australia and elsewhere. However, limited studies indicate very low biomass yield response when planted from seed and harvested with a forage harvester during the 1st year’s growth, or when 1-year-old seedlings were coppiced after a full year for establishment and growth. Sheep are able to digest the majority of seeds within the pods. However, for complete utilization by sheep, cattle, horses or swine, pods and seeds must be machine processed.
Apiculture: Flowers are very attractive to bees, which make honey from the nectar.
The specific gravity of the wood is 0.60 green, 0.67 oven-dry, and it is considered an excellent source of fuelwood.
Timber: The wood is strong, hard and durable, resistant to shock, and reddish-brown with attractive figuring; it is used locally for fence posts, pallets, crating, general construction, railroad ties and by woodworkers for making guitars.
Shade or shelter: G. triacanthos is hardy and drought tolerant; it can be grown in windbreaks with the added benefit of pod production.
Medicine: In Lesotho, fruit pulp is used for lung diseases. Powdered seed is used as snuff for head colds. Reported to be anodyne, mydriatic, narcotic, and experimentally oxytocic, G. triacanthos pods are a folk remedy for dyspepsia and measles, colds and fevers among the Indians of the USA; Delaware Indians used the bark for blood disorders and coughs. The bark tea treats whooping cough.
Gum or resin: The gum from the seeds has been suggested as an emulsifying substitute for acacia gum and tragacanth.
Ornamental: Its readiness to grow from seed, rapid growth, easy culture and extreme hardiness are among the commendable characters that make this tree popular for planting in gardens, parks or along highways. It has been widely planted as a replacement for American elm in North America and Canada with over 50 recognized cultivars. Budding can produce thornless trees with scionwood taken from the upper branches of selected cultivars. Thornless seedlings can be selected at a very early age (within 10 weeks of germination) for use as ornamental cultivars.
Intercropping: Widely spaced overstorey fodder trees (fodder orchard) can be planted for on-farm silvopastoral systems and should be compatible with a variety of forage, grain, vegetable, woody perennials or animals in the understorey.
Alcohol: A potable or energy alcohol can be made by fermenting the pulp."
Gliricidia sepium,"Local names:
 Creole (piyon), English (gliricidia,tree of iron,St. Vincent plum,Mexican lilac,mother of cocoa,quick stick,Nicaraguan cacao shade), Filipino (kakwate,madre-cacao,kakawate,kukuwatit,balok-balok,apatot), French (lilas étranger,madre de cacao,immortelle),
Gliricidia sepium grows to a height of 2-15 m, has a medium crown and may be single or multistemmed. The bark colour is variable but is mainly greyish-brown, and it can be much fissured. The tree has deep roots when mature.

Leaves are alternate and pinnate with (min. 7) 13-21 (max. 25) leaflets, papery, oblong with a distinctive pointed tip. Leaflet size increases towards the distal end of the leaf. At maturity, the upper surface ranges from smooth and hairless to bristly and usually has no tanniniferous patches. The lower surface can also be smooth and hairless or bristly but commonly has purplish tanniniferous patches concentrated toward the centre of the lamina.

Flowers arranged on conspicuously short, upward-curving to erect inflorescences, which are usually pink, fading to whitish-brown or pale purple with age. 

Pods explosively dehiscent, strongly laterally compressed and pale green or reddish-pink when unripe, turning pale yellow-brown when fully ripe. Seeds transversely oriented, lenticular, not constricted in the middle. Seeds uniformly light brown, turning dark brown with age; 3-10 seeds in a single pod.

The generic name Gliricidia refers to “mouse killer” in Latin, and the species epithet is named from the Latin saepes meaning hedge.
Ecology

G. sepium occurs naturally in early and middle successional vegetation types on disturbed sites such as coastal sand dunes, river banks, floodplains and fallow land. It establishes well on steep slopes (40% gradient). Temperatures below 15 deg. C cause leaf fall and poor growth.
Native range
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, United States of America
Tree management

Pruning and pollarding are the main management activities. Pruning at 0.3-1.5 m will stimulate leaf production. Pollarding at 2 m or above is recommended for optimal wood biomass production. Coppicing is used where the primary objective is fuelwood production. G. sepium has been shown to tolerate lopping and browsing.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability is maintained for 12 months in open storage. There are about 8500 seeds/kg.

Pretreatment of G. sepium seed is often not necessary, particularly where fresh seeds are used. However, when seeds are not fresh, soaking overnight in hot water is required and planting should proceed immediately thereafter. Seed or seedling inoculation with suitable strains of rhizobium is necessary where G. sepium is not naturalized. Direct sowing of seeds requires good land preparation and regular weeding: 90-100% germination occurs in 7 days. Where nursery seedlings are used, plantable size is attained in 3 months. 

G. sepium is propagated most commonly by cuttings, although this is not the most appropriate method for establishment in poor soils. Spacing is determined by the planting objective.
Poison: The leaves, seeds or powdered bark are toxic to humans when mixed with cooked rice or maize and fermented. The mechanism of toxicity is not understood. G. sepium has found application as a rodenticide and general pesticide. 
G. sepium has been planted to reclaim denuded land or land infested with Imperata cylindrica.
Erosion control: Hedgerows in alley cropping serve to suppress weed growth and control erosion and have been shown to reduce the incidence of disease in groundnut crops. 
 Flowers can be fried and eaten.
Fodder: G. sepium leaves are rich in protein and highly digestible, and low in fibre and tannin. There is evidence of improved animal production (both milk and meat) in large and small ruminants when G. sepium is used as a supplement. Goats on G. sepium gained weight and maintained a positive N balance. However, non-ruminants fed on G. sepium have shown clear signs of poisoning. Perceptions of palatability vary greatly around the world. There are reports from India and Indonesia of limitations to its use because animals will not eat it. In some areas, such as Colombia and Sri Lanka, there is no palatability constraint and it is an important dry-season feed. 
Apiculture: The flowers attract honeybees (Apis spp.), hence it is an important species for honey production.
Often used for firewood and charcoal production. The wood burns slowly without sparking and with little smoke, so it is an important fuelwood in the subhumid tropics. The calorific value of a 5-year-old tree is 4550 kcal/kg.
Timber: Gliricidia has light brown sapwood and dark brown heartwood, turning reddish-brown on exposure to air. It is hard, coarse textured with an irregular grain, very durable and termite resistant. Wood is utilized for railway sleepers, farm implements, furniture, house construction and as mother posts in live-fence establishment.
Shade or shelter: G. sepium is widely cultivated as shade for perennial crops (tea, coffee and cocoa). It is also used as a nurse tree for shade-loving species. Attributes contributing to its value as a shade tree include its fine, feathery foliage giving
Medicine: Crude extracts have been shown to have antifungal activity. Reported to be expectorant, sedative and suppurative. Madre de cacao is a folk remedy for alopecia, boils, bruises, burns, colds, cough, debility, eruptions, erysipelas, fever, fractures, gangrene, headache, itch, prickly heat, rheumatism, skin tumours, ulcers, urticaria and wounds.
Nitrogen fixing: The tree is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. 
Suitable for live fencing around cattle pastures and for delineating boundaries. Its fast growth, ease of propagation, nitrogen fixing ability and light canopy makes it ideal as a live stakes. It has been used to support bl
Soil improver: As a green manure, G. sepium increases soil organic matter; it aids in recycling of soil nutrients as it produces much litter. It also improves soil aeration and reduces soil temperature. It is a drought-resistant and valuable water-conserving species, because in the dry season it sheds most of its leaves, hence reducing water loss through transpiration.
Other services: The predictable relationship between flowering in G. sepium and the onset of the rainy season in Venezuela shows that it is a promising indicator species."
Gmelina arborea,"Local names:
 Bengali (gamari,gumbar,gumhar,gomari,gamar), Burmese (mai saw,yemari,yemane,yemani), English (white teak,yemane,Malay beechwood,Kashmir tree,Candahar tree,beechwood,goomar teak,gmelina), French (melina,gmelina,peuplier d Afrique), German (Gumar-Teak), Gu
Gmelina arborea is an unarmed, moderately sized to large deciduous tree with a straight trunk. It is wide spreading with numerous branches forming a large shady crown, attains a height of 30 m or more and a diameter of up to 4.5 m. Bark smooth, pale ashy-grey or grey to yellow with black patches and conspicuous corky circular lenticels. Inside surface of bark rapidly turns brown on exposure and exfoliates into thick woody plates or scurfy flakes. Blaze pale orange and mottled with a darker orange colour.

Leaves opposite-decussate, mostly rather soft and limp; petioles cylindrical, 5-15 cm long, puberulent or glabrous; leaf blades broadly ovate, 10-25 cm x 7-20 cm wide, apically long acuminate or caudate, entire on mature plants but strongly toothed or lobed on young plants, usually cordate or trunkate basally, with a short cuneate attenuation into the petiole, densely tomentose above when young, becoming glabrous above when mature, permanently densely fulvulous-tomentellous with stellate hairs beneath, glanduliferous just above the petiole on the basal attenuation.

Flowers abundant, scented, reddish, brown or yellow, in terminal and axillary 1- to-3-flowered cymes on the panicle branches, which are about 8-40 cm long. Flower 2.5-5 cm in diameter; bracts 8 mm long, linear lanceolate; calyx broadly campanulate, about 5 mm long, densely fulvous-tomentose externally, the rim with 5 small, triangular, acute teeth; corolla large, showy, varying from yellow to orange or brilliant orange to reddish- or brownish-yellow, dull yellow-brown, tubular below, obliquely funnel-form at the throat, the tube densely pubescent externally, the limb 2-lipped, the upper lip often orange-pink, deeply divided into 2 oblong, obtuse, backwardly curled lobules, the lower lip often lemon yellow, up to twice as long as the upper and 3-lobed.

Fruit a drupe, 1.8-2.5 cm long, obovoid, seated on the enlarged calyx, glossy and yellow when ripe; exocarp succulent and aromatic; endocarp bony and usually 2-celled. Seeds 1-3, lenticular, exalbuminous.

The genus was named after J.C. Gmelin, an 18th-century German botanist. The specific name means treelike, from the Latin ‘arbor’ (tree).
Ecology

The species occurs in a variety of forest habitats, including tropical semi-evergreen, sub-montane, very moist teak forests, deciduous, sal and dry teak forests. It also occurs in Syzygium parkland and low alluvial savannah woodland. The tree is a light demander, although it can stand some shade. It is moderately frost hardy and recovers quickly from frost injuries.

G. arborea occurs in the western Himalayas. Its choice of site is wide, but it shows a preference for moist fertile valleys with sandy loam soil; in west Bengal, this species grows best on high silt deposits near rivers. It does not thrive where the drainage is poor, while on dry, sandy or otherwise poor soil it remains stunted and is apt to assume little more than a shrubby form because of repeated dying back through drought.

Tree management

G. arborea has suitable characteristics for agroforestry, with fast growth, ease of establishment, and relative freedom from pests outside its natural range (it can be browsed repeatedly without damage). It is an especially promising fuelwood species because it can be established easily, regenerates well from both sprouts and seeds, and is fast growing. Trees coppice well with vigorous shoot growth. Although able to compete with weeds more successfully than many other species, it responds positively to weeding and also benefits from irrigation.
Viable seeds should be collected from standing trees of superior phenotype. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 7-10% mc. On average, there are 1400 seeds/kg.

It does not thrive where the drainage is poor, while on dry, sandy or otherwise poor soil it remains stunted and is apt to assume little more than a shrubby form because of repeated dying back through drought.
Normally, seed is collected from the ground, depulped and the stones are dried. Pretreatment is not necessary. For quick germination, the seeds should be soaked for 48 hours. The seeds germinate within 20-50 days under ideal conditions; the average rate for a healthy seed lot is 60%. Trees can be raised easily by transplanting, which is carried out in the rainy season, or by direct sowing in lines; the latter has proved to be more successful in some instances. Large cuttings planted during the rainy season do well.
G. arborea is a highly light-demanding species and regenerates naturally only in the open and on the edge of forests. It is an ideal choice for large-scale afforestation programmes.
 The fruit of G. arborea is edible.
Fodder: Leaves are regarded as good fodder and cattle eat the fruit.
Apiculture: Flowers produce abundant nectar, which produces high-quality honey.
G. arborea is planted mostly for firewood, which has a calorific value of 4800 kcal/kg. For firewood, a spacing of 2 x 2 m is recommended. Plantations of G. arborea have been established for tobacco curing.
Fibre: The wood produces good-quality pulp. Unmixed semi-chemical pulp is suitable only for carton board or low-grade writing paper, but kraft pulp of yemane wood is suitable for higher grades of writing paper. It is also utilized for particle board.
Timber: When 1st cut, the wood is yellowish- to reddish-white, turning light russet or yellowish-brown with a density of 400-560 kg/cubic m. The wood seasons well without degrading, but it is slow to dry both in the open and in a kiln. Where it is indigenous, it is regarded as a valuable general-purpose wood because of its dimensional stability. The natural durability of the wood is about 15 years. Uses include the manufacture of furniture, plywood core stock, mine props, matches and timber for light construction.
Tannin or dyestuff: Both wood ash and fruit yield a very persistent yellow dye.
Medicine: Bark, leaves and roots contain traces of alkaloids and are used medicinally in its native range, such as in Hindu medicine. For example, both fruit and bark have medicinal properties against bilious fever.
Ornamental: G. arborea is sometimes planted as an avenue tree. 
Intercropping: Planting G. arborea with crops like maize and cassava has been found beneficial in increasing the simultaneous production of wood and food. When intercropped with maize and cassava, it performs better under closely stocked stands of cassava, yams and maize. Cassava, however, suppresses re-growth of stumped trees and should, therefore, be planted 3 months later. Spacing for optimum yields of both crops was 2.5 x 2.5 m for Gmelina and 1 x 1 m for both yams and maize. Gmelina forms an integral component of a taungya system where it is intercropped with peanut, cashewnut, tobacco, maize and beans. Some limitations are that it casts heavy shade, and nothing will grow under a dense 2 x 2 m stand; it forms a leaf carpet beneath trees, creating a mild fire hazard in times of prolonged drought; and the palatability of the foliage is a drawback to establishing woodlots near villages. Valuable in coffee and cocoa plantations to protect young trees and to suppress invasive grasses. 
Other services: After 18 months of growth, the tree’s low, dense canopy provides effective weed control"
Gnetum africanum,"Local names:
 English (eru), French (koko), Igbo (okazi), Portuguese (nkoko)
Gnetum africanum is a dioecious forest perrenial liana up to 10 m long but sometimes longer; branches somewhat thickened at the nodes, glabrous. 

Leaves decussately opposite, sometimes in whorls of 3, simple, ovate-oblong or elliptic-oblong, more rarely lanceolate, 5-13 cm long, 2- 5 cm broad, attenuate at base, abruptly acuminate, obtuse or minutely apiculate, entire, thick-papery, glabrous, pale green above, paler beneath, with 3-6 pairs of strongly curved lateral veins looped near the margin; stipules absent; petiole up to 1 cm long.

Inflorescence an unbranched catkin, axillary or terminal on a short branch, solitary but male inflorescences at apex of branches often in groups of 3, up to 8 cm long, jointed, peduncle 1-1.5 cm long, with a pair of scale-like, triangular bracts; male inflorescence with slender internodes and whorls of flowers at nodes; female inflorescence with slightly turbinate internodes and 2-3 flowers at each node. Flowers small, c. 2 mm long, with moniliform hairs at base and an envelope; male flowers with a tubular envelope and exserted staminal column bearing 2 anthers; female flowers with cupular envelope and naked, sessile ovule. 

Seed resembling a drupe, ellipsoid, 10-15 mm × 4-8 mm, apiculate, enclosed in the fleshy envelope, orange-red when ripe, with copious endosperm.

This lianoid species lacks fibre-tracheids characteristic of G. gnemon. However, tori are clearly present in tracheary elements of this species.

In Africa, there are only two species, G.africanum and G. buchholzianum. The specific epithet africanum refers to its African origin.

The plant is threatened with disappearance because of intensive gathering and cultural practices which are destroying the forests which support these plants. Possible introduction into farm systems is a step in the right direction in conserving this plant.
Ecology

G. africanum is an endangered liane normally found in humid tropical forest. It is usually found with other climbers on middle- and under-storey trees, frequently forming thickets. It can also be found in riverine forest in areas that are otherwise too dry for the species. Gnetum africanum is mostly found at the periphery of primary forest and in secondary forest. It extends in distribution from SE Nigeria, to Congo and as far as Angola in the south.

Tree management

Gnetum africanum is still mainly collected from wild stands, but farmers often retain it when clearing fields. If cultivated, farmers need to provide support, e.g. by using commercial plantations of rubber trees, oil palm and other tree crops. Fences were only found to be successful when there is enough shade, and they are generally too expensive. Fully exposed plants do not grow well; their leaves are thin and pale green, and traders reject them.

It can also be found in riverine forest in areas that are otherwise too dry for the species. Gnetum africanum is mostly found at the periphery of primary forest and in secondary forest. It extends in distribution from SE Nigeria, to Congo and as far as Angola in the south.
In Cameroon, propagation by seed was difficult because germination take one year or more. It is assumed that seeds need pretreatment, such as passing through the intestines of a bird, fruit bat, squirrel or other animal, before they germinate. Seed is normally found only in the tree canopy. Seed collection is thus far from easy, a further reason why Gnetum africanum is hardly cultivated. 

Methods of vegetative propagation using leafy stem cuttings have recently been developed. It is recommended that leaf blades of cuttings be trimmed in half. Nursery beds under shade and made of well-decomposed sawdust or fine river sand can be used for propagation. Ectomycorrhizae (such as Scleroderma sinnamarense) assist the roots in absorption of nutrients . After about 6 weeks the rooted cuttings are transferred to polythene sleeves, bamboo pots or other containers where they remain for a further 2-3 months. The soil mixture for these containers consists of 25% sand and some compost, supplemented with forest soil. Field planting, preferably next to a young tree or shrub, takes place at the beginning of the rainy season.
  The leaves of this species are edible, as are those of other American and Asian Gnetum species. G. africanum holds an important place in the diets of many people in central Africa. In the Congo Gnetum consumption has been evaluated at 2g /capita. Women play a great role in the gathering and selling of the much relished leaves all year round. Commerce in Gnetum has increased considerably. A company, 'Paysans Centrafricains' has exported leaves to Europe particularly France and Belgium.  It is a significant source of protein (16.5% dry wt.) carbohydrates (70.6% dry wt.), essential amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine), non essential amino acids (aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, proline,glycine, alanine, cysteine, tyrosine histidine and arginine) and mineral constituents i.e. macro and micro-elements (7.0% dry wt.).  It can be eaten raw, but is generally added to meat and fish dishes after cooking time. The fruit and seeds are edible.
Lipids:  The leaf fat content in gnetum is significant, up to 14.20% (Okafor et al.1996.).
Medicine:  The leaves are used to treat enlarged spleen, sore throat and also used as a cathartic. The plant provides an arrow poison antidote. In West Africa chopped leaves are used as a dressing on furuncles to hasten maturation. The stem is used in making preparations to ease childbirth.
Alcohol:  The potential of African species to yield a potable sap as the Asian species is worth investigation.
Has significant cultural value in traditional ceremonies."
Gnetum costatum,"Local names:
Dioecious tree, 15-20 m tall; bark reddish-brown outside, tan inside.  

Leaves obovate to elliptical, 15-18 cm long, thin, slightly thicker than in G. gnemon, yellowish when dry, tapering at both ends, petiole 0.5 cm, secondary nerves bent, joining.

Male inflorescences solitary, axillary, simple, yellowish, 6-7 cm long, whorls with hairs and sessile flowers remote, 3 mm broad, male flowers with tender long-exserted sporophyll (stamen), female flowers sterile, ovate, beaked, finely whitish pubescent, up to 10 in a ring.  Female inflorescences similar, their flowers immersed in dense whitish hairs, flowers long-acuminate, finely whitish pubescent.

Fruit nut-like, obliquely-fusiform, 4 cm x 1 cm, red or pink, tapering at base, acuminate at top, its outer envelope thin, fleshy, showing the longitudinal ribs of the hard middle envelope when dry.

Seed fusiform, furrowed.
Ecology

The tree occurs in rain forests at altitudes up to 1350 m.  It is common on ridge tops, along or near river banks and also in secondary or distrubed forest.  In New Guinea the species is commonly found in mixed forest of Lithocarpus, Anisoptera and Hopea species.  It does not occur in swamps or in areas with a high water table.  Areas experiencing both wet and dry seasons seem to be ideal for the species.

 Fruits, often with the leaves and inflorescences (both male and female) are boiled with other vegetables together in one pot and served.  The fruits require a longer time to boil than those of G. gnemon in order to remove the bitter taste.  Coconut milk is normally added to improve the taste. The kernels, leaves and inflorescences contain starch (40-45%) and protein (8-10%).
Fibre: The inner bark provides a fibre which is used for making string bags known as 'bilum'.  A similar fibre is also extracted from other Gnetum species, that of G. gnemon being most commonly used.
Timber: The wood is of no commercial value."

Gnetum gnemon is a shade tolerant, slender evergreen tree, up to 15 m tall. Usually branching in whorls from the base and deeply rooted with a strong tap root system.
G. gnemon does not develop buttresses, the trunk is most recognisable with regular swollen rings around the girth, marking the position of old branches.

Leaves broad (10-20 cm), opposite, dark green, shiny, elliptic with netted veins.

Flowers are monosexual; in catkin-like formations; the male flower consists of a stamen and perianth ;female flowers, 5-8 at each node have an ovule with two integuments and a perianth.

Fruits ellipsoid usually in clusters,1-3.5 cm long and half as wide, turning yellow to orange-red then purple at maturity.

G. gnemon exists in several varieties, such as the tree form (var. gnemon) and the shrub forms (vars. Brunonianum, griffithii and tenerum).
Ecology

Occasional in lowland ridges and mature fallow forest. Commonly found in secondary humid evergreen dipterocarp forests of S.E. Asia. Commonly cultivated in or near gardens and in home gardens in South East Asia.
Native range
Fiji, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands
Daily watering of the sand and seed mixture will hasten germination, possibly to three months. Without a pre-germination treatment, germination may be 1-2% in 6 months and may reach 100%  in 12 months. Greater seedling height in inoculated seedlings can be achieved by providing compost and rock phosphate.
Occasional in lowland ridges and mature fallow forest. Commonly found in secondary humid evergreen dipterocarp forests of S.E. Asia. Commonly cultivated in or near gardens and in home gardens in South East Asia.
The popular propagation method is by direct seeding. However, vegetative propagation is possible by air layering, grafting, oculation and cuttings. Addition of humic acids at 400 mg/litre yielded the fastest growth of shoots from nodal segments in tissue culture experiments with G. gnemon.
Poison:  Woodsmoke and topical applications reduced biting of human volunteers by the anopheline mosquitoes (Anopheles punctulatus, A. koliensis, A. bancroftii, A. karwari and A. farauti) by 79% and 51%, respectively (Paru et al. 1995). Enzymic inhibition prevents insect predation of foliage.
It is possible to use this tree for dryland rehabilitation and afforestation. It can survive annual rainfall of 750-1000 mm
  The nutritious seeds are consumed as a snack called emping, and the young leaves, flowers and fruits are used as vegetables; eaten either raw, boiled or roasted. The seed is cooked or preserved as pounded flat cakes from which crispy snacks can be made. An active trade in the seeds exists and small to medium size emping industries exist in Indonesia, specifically in west Java, central Java and northern Sumatra.
Fibre:  Its bast fibers provide durable cordage for fishing nets, lines, string bags and other durable tools. A potential economic use of this plant is the utilisation of its bark in rope making. 
Timber:  Wood used in Indonesia for pulp and house construction and in Malaysia, and Hong Kong for paper, boxes, and housing.
Shade or shelter:  Provides shade for sciophytic plant species.
Medicine:  Leaf sap used medicinally to cure an eye complication.
Nitrogen fixing:  Has the ability to improve nitrogen levels due to its mycorrhizal associations.with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Scleroderma sinnamariense. In experimental conditions, mycorrhizal inoculation appears to enhance seedling growth under shaded conditions in acidic soils.
Soil improver:  Has the ability to improve physical soil properties.
Intercropping:  When intercropped with yams, can act as stakes for climbing yams, pana and other understorey shrubs.
Alcohol:  Prospects of making a potable sap from this species should be explored."
Gonystylus bancanus,"Local names:
 Filipino (lanutan-bagyo,anauan), Indonesian (ramin), Malay (merang,gaharu buaya)
Gonystylus bancanus is a tree to 40-45 m tall with a straight, cylindrical bole; branchless to 21 m and a diameter of up to 120 cm. The tree is sometimes slightly fluted at the base with many knee-roots (pneumatophores). The bark surface is often cracked and shows greyish to red brown colour while inner bark is yellow and fibrous.

Leaves elliptical, oblong-oblanceolate or obovate, 4-14.5 cm x 2-7 cm, broadly cuneate to rounded at the base, suddenly narrowing into a point; petiole 8-18 mm long.

Inflorescence up to 9 cm long with short, adpressed hairs. Flowers with 8-14 mm long pedicels and 13-20, narrowly lanceolate, glabrous petals.

Fruit sub-globose, up to 4.5 cm long, with 3-4 valves, minutely rough but not rugose, 1-3 seeds per fruit.

Seeds compressed ovoid, black, 28 x 22 x 6 mm, partly enclosed in a thin aril.
Ecology

G. bancanus is a gregarious, often dominant tree of lowland freshwater swamp and peat-swamp forest. It is a lowland species growing in freshwater swamp and coastal peat-swamp forest including peripheral mixed swamp forest and Shorea albida forest, occasionally forming pure stands. In these forests it is associated with Calophyllum kunstlerii, Xylopia malacensis, Mezzetia parvifolia, and Shorea pauciflora as a top layer of the vegetation. Large areas of peat swamp forest have been cleared for agriculture, with extensive development of oil palm and pineapple plantations.
Native range
Brunei, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Solomon Islands
Tree management

G. bancanus tolerates waterlogging and self-prunes. Since seedlings and saplings require shade, the planting should be in the strip or line planting system in logged-over or secondary peat-swamp forest, with spacing of 5 m by 5 m in logged-over forest and 3 m by 1 m in secondary forest. After 2-3 years the shade can be gradually removed to stimulate growth.

First thinning is carried out at an age of 5 years in a planted forest, and from then on at intervals of 3 years up to the age of 20 years, and subsequently at intervals of 5 years up to the felling age. In Indonesia, natural ramin peat-swamp forest is managed under the Indonesian selective felling and planting system, with a diameter limit of 35 cm and a cutting cycle of 35 years. At least 25 healthy trees per ha of over 15 cm diameter should be left as core trees. In Sarawak large areas of logged-over mixed peat-swamp forest are regularly treated to stimulate regeneration and growth of ramin.
The fruits open and release the seeds when ripe. The freshly fallen seeds are collected from the ground. As access to the swamp forest where G. bancanus grows is often very difficult, seed collection is generally carried out only around log slide tracks.

The freshly collected seeds have a moisture content of about 40-45%, and during transportation from collection sites, the seeds have to be protected from excessive loss of moisture, e.g. by placing them under shade in moist gunny sacks. At the processing site, the seeds are washed and air-dried on the surface. 

The seeds storage behaviour is recalcitrant. The seeds can be stored temporarily with moist sawdust in sealed polyethylene bags in an air-conditioned room (18° C). After longer periods of storage, the seeds begin to germinate. There are 250-300 seeds/kg.

Large areas of peat swamp forest have been cleared for agriculture, with extensive development of oil palm and pineapple plantations.
G. bancanus can be planted using wildings, nursery raised seedlings and cuttings. The seeds are soaked in water for 24 hours prior to sowing in order to enhance germination. They are sown in sand or a mixture of sawdust and soil (2:1) in shady conditions. The  seedbed should be covered with transparent material (e.g. plastic) to avoid excessive moisture loss. Germination begins about 5 days and is completed after about 30 days. In the nursery the seedlings should be placed under shade. The seedlings are ready for planting after 8-11 months when they are about 20 cm tall.
Poison: The pounded fruits are sometimes used as fish poison.
In Kalimantan, seedlings are used in enrichment planting.
 The fruits and leaves provide food for wild animals such as swamp monkeys
Timber: The timber has white to light yellowish-white heartwood, moderately fine with even texture, and density of 0.54-0.75 g/cm3 (moisture content 15%). It is very suitable for veneer and plywood, and highly valued for light construction including door and window frames, moulding, skirting, ceilings and partitions. Among other things it is used for decorative cabinets, furniture, interior decoration, wall panelling, light flooring, toys, turnery, broom handles and other non-impact handles, venetian blind slats, dowels, rulers, picture frames, and drawing boards. Populations and habitats of the species have decreased sharply due to over exploitation.
Medicine: A decoction of the roots is administered after childbirth as a protective medicine."
Grevillea robusta,"Local names:
 Burmese (khadaw hmi), English (silk oak,southern silky oak,silver oak,silky oak,silk-oak grevillea,grevillea,river oak), French (chêne d'Australie,Grevillée robuste), German (Australische seideneiche), Hawaian (oka-kilika,haiku-keokeo), Indonesian (salam
Grevillea robusta is a deciduous medium-sized to large tree 12-25 (max. 40) m tall; crown conical, dense, with branches projecting upwards. Bole straight, branchless for up to 15 m, up to 80 (max. 120) cm in diameter, usually without buttresses; bark fissured, sometimes pustulate, dark grey to dark brown, inner bark reddish-brown. 

Leaves alternate, fernlike, pinnately (almost bipinnately) compound, 15-30 cm long, exstipulate; 11-21 pairs side axes (pinnae), 4-9 cm long, deeply divided into narrow, long, pointed lobes 6-12 mm wide, upper surfaces shiny dark green and hairless, underneath silky with whitish or ash-coloured hairs.

Flowers showy, yellowish, numerous, paired, on long slender stalks 1-2 cm, composed of 4 narrow yellow or orange sepals 12 mm long. Flower clusters 7.5-15 cm long, unbranched, arising mostly from the trunk, in a terminal or axillary simple or branched raceme, protandrous, petals 4, united into a tube that is mostly recurved under the broadened apex (limb); stamens 4, sessile in the concave limb; disk annular or semi-annular, sometimes bilobed; ovary superior, 1-locular with 2 ovules, style curved and protruding from a slit in the perianth tube, the apex free from the limb, eventually straight, persistent.

Fruits podlike, broad, slightly flattened (boat shaped), 2 cm long, black with long slender stalk and long, threadlike, curved style; 1 or 2 seeds, 10-13 mm long, elliptical, brown, flattened with wing all around a coriaceous to woody follicle, usually oblique and opening along the ventral margin.

The name commemorates Charles F. Greville (1749-1809), one of the founders of the Royal Horticultural Society of London.
Ecology

G. robusta occurs naturally in 2 distinct habitats: riverine rainforest in association with either Castanospermum australe or Casuarina cunninghamiana; or in vine forest dominated by Araucaria cunninghamii. Rainfall distribution has a summer maximum in the natural range, but G. robusta also grows well in climates with a winter maximum or a bimodal rainfall regime. In temperate areas, it can survive moderate winter frosts. It is not resistant to persistent strong winds. In its natural range, the species is semi-deciduous, shedding most of its leaves in the dry season, and can stand up to 6 months of drought.

Tree management

Moderate to fast growing. When climate and soil are suitable and weed competition is not severe, annual height and diameter increments of at least 2 m and 2 cm, respectively, are usually achieved for the 1st few years in row planting on farms. Annual height increments of 3 m have been observed at the most favourable sites. G. robusta regrows well after complete defoliation following pruning and pollarding, which can be carried out repeatedly to yield wood and to regulate shading and competition with adjacent crops. It is characterized by root suckering, hence it is a good candidate for management under coppice rotation; it responds well to pollarding, lopping and pruning. A plant density of 800-1200 trees/ha is recommended for plantations. Some control of competing vegetation is required for the 1st 1-2 years after planting. Seedlings are normally planted at a spacing of 2.5-3 x 3-4 m. The relatively open canopy of G. robusta makes it less suitable for areas with erosional hazard. It also easily regenerates naturally, especially in agricultural fields. For firewood production, rotations of 10-20 years are applied and annual volume increments of 5-15 cubic m/ha may be expected. A growth reduction after 20 years is reported. The species is known to produce substances toxic to its own seedlings.
Collection of seeds from mature trees is very difficult because the seeds are borne on thin and inaccesible branches at great heights and are easily lost during collection. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; whole seed have 28.5% mc; 60-70% germination following 2 years of hermetic storage at -7 deg. C with 10% mc; 35% germination following 12 months of open storage. Seeds were maintained for 4 years in commercial storage conditions; viability was maintained for 2 years in hermetic air-dry storage at 3 deg. C. There are between 24 000 and 105 000 seeds/kg.

In temperate areas, it can survive moderate winter frosts. It is not resistant to persistent strong winds. In its natural range, the species is semi-deciduous, shedding most of its leaves in the dry season, and can stand up to 6 months of drought.
G. robusta can be propagated through seed and cuttings, although seed is difficult to collect because of the great size of the tree. No pretreatment of seed is required, and it germinates readily in a moist environment. The optimum temperature for germination is about 25 deg. C at a rate of 60-80% in 20-28 days. Cuttings can be easily established using shoots from seedlings or saplings, which can also be air-layered.
Poison: The flower buds, fruit and seeds are cyanogenic. Through contact with the leaves, sensitive persons may develop contact dermatitis due to tridecylresorcinol, a chemical compound related to the allergen toxicodendron.
G. robusta is a pioneering colonizer of disturbed sites.
Apiculture: The golden flowers are attractive to bees, making it an important honey plant. G. robusta honey is dark amber, of high density with a pronounced flavour.
G. robusta is popular for firewood and charcoal. It is also used to fuel locomotives and river steamers, power boilers and small industries. The calorific value of sapwood is about 4800 kcal/kg, while that of heartwood is 4950 kcal/kg.
Fibre: Mean fibre length is about 1.5 mm and width about 26 µm; the wood is suitable for pulping.
Timber: Grevillea yields a medium-weight hardwood with a density of 540-720 kg/cubic m at 15% moisture content. The timber has economic potential. Heartwood is pale pink-brown, turning to yellow-brown or red-brown on exposure; moderately clearly differentiated from the cream-coloured to pale pink sapwood; grain straight to wavy; texture medium to coarse and uneven; wood lustrous; prominent silver grain on radial surface.  Shrinkage upon seasoning is low to moderate; seasoning properties are rated from good to poor; wood air-dries slowly. It has a tendency to warp and check; therefore, thick material should be air-dried slowly followed by a mild kiln schedule to avoid honeycombing. The wood is hard, of low strength, but elastic, can be peeled and sliced satisfactorily, is moderately durable to non-durable and shows an absorption of creosote of 128 kg/cubic m when treated by open-tank method and 321 kg/cubic m with pressure treatment. The wood is susceptible to marine borer, pinhole borer and termite attack. It is easy to work with hand and machine tools, but cutting at an angle of 10 degrees is required to obtain a good finish on quarter-sawn faces. The wood is used in making railroad ties, plywood, panelling, air-freight cases and furniture, parquetry, turnery, boat building, interior trim, cabinet work, parquet flooring, boxes, toys and novelties.
Shade or shelter: This is a well known shade tree in coffee and tea plantations. Its spreading branching system makes it ideal for windbreaks or shelterbelts against wind-induced mechanical damage, high rates of transpiration and surface evaporation.
Gum or resin: By virtue of their solubility, viscosity and relatively high resistance to hydrolysis, G. robusta gums may have some industrial applications.
Ornamental: Its majestic height, attractive shape and beautiful foliage make G. robusta an ideal tree for landscaping of private and public gardens. The cut leaves are used in flower arrangements, and young plants are grown as indoor pot plants in Europe.
Soil improver: G. robusta provides abundant quantities of leaf mulch, which may accumulate to a depth of 30-40 cm. This thick layer protects the soil and maintains soil temperature. The leaves and twigs are apparently rich in aluminium.
Intercropping: A deep rooting system causes little interference with shallow-rooted crops, and it can be successfully intercropped with banana, tomato and other agricultural crops."
Grewia asiatica,"Local names:

Grewia asiatica is a small deciduous tree or large straggling shrub, up to 4.5 m tall; bark rough, grey; branches long, slender, drooping, young ones densely coated with stellate hairs.

Leaves are alternate, simple, deciduous, broadly cordate to ovate, rather variable, up to 20 x 16 cm, base oblique, apex acute to acuminate, margins coarsely toothed, pubescent above, densely tomentose beneath, 5 principle nerves palmate, petiole up to 1.5 cm long.

Inflorescence in 3-5 flowered axillary cymes, clustered in groups of 2-8, 16-25 cm long. Receptacle 3 mm long, hairy in the upper half. Sepals 5, oblong, 1-5 cm, almost glabrous inside, 3-5-nerved. Petals 5, yellow, 6-7 mm long, equalling the androecium, with a raised gland 2 mm long, glabrous, with reticulate nervation.

Fruit a globose drupe. 1.8-2.2 cm in diameter, indistinctly lobed, red or purple, finely warty and with stellate hairs; flesh, soft, fibrous, greenish-white stained with purplish-red, tasting pleasantly acid. Seeds 1-2, hemispherical, 5 mm wide.

The genus was named after Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712), one of the founders of plant physiology.
Ecology

The plant grows in both tropical and subtropical climates but will tolerate other climates, except at high altitude; however, it does best in regions having distinct summer and winter seasons. It is very hardy, and capable of existing under severe conditions, for example, it can withstand short periods of light frost and tolerate drought, and is therefore suitable for arid regions. In the absence of a prominent change of seasons the plant does not shed its leaves, flowers erratically throughout the year and fruits poorly. This limits its distribution in Southeast Asia.
Native range
India, Nepal
Tree management

If planted in infertile soil, a good amount of well-rotted farmyard manure should be placed around the planting hole. Weeding and judicious application of fertilizers and manure are recommended along with 2-3 irrigations. Pruning is an essential part of their cultivation, and it is recommended 1.2-1.35 m above ground level, as long as there is no risk of late frosts; it should be done every year as the new growth bears the fruit. It has to be harvested repeatedly during the fruiting season, which adds considerably to its cost. Fruit production increases by spraying gibberalic acid at full bloom. A 2nd spraying is done after 15 days. The annual yield is 3-5 kg/plant or 4.5-6 t/ha.

In the absence of a prominent change of seasons the plant does not shed its leaves, flowers erratically throughout the year and fruits poorly. This limits its distribution in Southeast Asia.
Propagation is mainly by seed, which does not require any presowing treatment. Fresh seeds are reported to give minimum germination; they take 15-20 days. Grafting, cutting and air-layering are all viable methods for vegetative propagation. Cuttings in open ground give poor results, but under closed conditions, with hormone treatment, they are better. Planting is usually done during the monsoon months, although dormant planting is also possible. The planting distance is 2.5-3 m.
 The ripe fruits are eaten as a dessert. Their taste and flavour are very much liked and they fetch high prices. A refreshing drink prepared from the juice, commonly known as phalsa syrup, is considered a delicacy in northern India, throughout the hot summer months. The mucilaginous extract of the bark obtained after pounding in water is used to clarify sugarcane juice during the preparation of ‘gur’, the traditional brown sugar made in India.
Fibre: The fibrous bark is made into ropes.
Timber: Grewia yields a medium-weight to heavy hardwood with a density of 730-900 kg/cubic m at 15% mc. Heartwood pale grey to pale brown, not sharply differentiated from the sapwood; grain interlocked; texture fine; wood with some silver grain. The wood seasons well, is moderately soft to moderately hard, tough and moderately strong; it works satisfactorily with hand and machine tools. Non-durable when exposed to the weather or in contact with the ground, but durable for interior use. Under cover, the heartwood is moderately resistant to dry-wood termites. Wood is generally used for small articles where toughness is required, such as tool handles, spades, shafts of golf sticks, shoulder poles for carrying small loads, pestles, bows, billiards cues and shingles. In the Philippines it is regarded as a good substitute for ‘lanutan’ (Hibiscus campylosiphon) and used for vehicle bodies. In India, the wood is sometimes used for construction. The shoots obtained after annual prunings are used for making baskets, quite strong, to transport fruit and vegetables.
Medicine: According to Ayurveda, the ancient Indian treatise on medicine, the fruits are a cooling tonic and aphrodisiac; they allay thirst and burning sensations, remove biliousness, cure inflammation, heart and blood disorders and fevers. The fruit is also good against throat trouble. The bark is used as a demulcent. It cures urinary troubles and relieves burning in the vagina. The leaves also are used medicinally, chiefly for external applications.
Soil improver: In India, 5-year-old plantations of phalsa increased organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil, and reduced calcium carbonate, pH and bulk density due to litter production greater than that of other fruits."

Grewia bicolor is usually a many-stemmed shrub, occasionally small tree up to 7 m in height; bark dark grey, deeply fissured and peeling away in strips in older specimens, grey to reddish-grey, and smooth when young. 

Leaves elliptic to elliptic-oblong or lanceolate, 1.5-7 x 1-3.2 cm, dark, dull green above, almost silvery white with fine hairs below; the leaves are held horizontally or slightly drooping; apex tapering to rounded; base broadly tapering to rounded, asymmetric, or almost symmetric; margin finely toothed, occasionally almost entire; petiole very short.

Flowers yellow, 1.5 cm in diameter, axillary, often produced in profusion; the central mass of stamens characteristic of the genus.

Fruit single, or 2-lobed, each lobe about 6 mm in diameter, reddish-brown when mature, edible, sweetish but astringent. Fruits are often parasitized and develop a shaggy appearance.

The genus was named after Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712), one of the founders of plant physiology. The specific name means 2-coloured; referring to the leaves; from the Latin ‘bis’ (two) and ‘color’ (colour).
Ecology

Occurs most frequently in dry deciduous woodland at low altitudes, on sandy flats and rocky mountain slopes; also at medium altitudes in high-rainfall areas, often associated with termite mounds and frequently found in riverine fringes. Tropical summer rainfall and subtropical arid climates are suitable. G. bicolor is very drought resistant.

Tropical summer rainfall and subtropical arid climates are suitable. G. bicolor is very drought resistant.
Fruit collected at end of rains, beginning of dry season. Regeneration is normally through seedlings and root suckers. Germination is good but sporadic; completed after 6 weeks. A suitable pretreatment is to soak the seeds in cold water for 12 hours. Can be propagated from cuttings. Strike rates tend to be low, e.g. 0% for rootstock cuttings, 12% for non-lignified, 19% for lignified and 60% for heel cuttings.
  Fruits edible, sweetish, but also astringent. The pulp is eaten fresh or dried and juice is drunk fresh. A mixture of the fruit is used to coat leather bottles containing new butter to improve flavour. Mucilaginous leaves used as binding agents for sauces. Fibres used to make ‘lalo’ a glutinant for giving couscous a smooth consistency. Bark is essential in brewing of ‘dolo’ in Burkina Faso, it cleans and removes bitterness.
Livestock and game browse on the fresh or dried leaves and young stems. It is favoured more by sheep and goats than by horses, donkeys and cattle. Nutritional value of leaves is average to good but varies according to age. Fruit is also a suitable forage.
Sought as a firewood only in certain areas, for example Senegal and Tanzania, but less valued elsewhere.
Fibre:  Bark fibres can be stripped and used for string, rope and cordage.
Timber:  Wood used for walking sticks and canes, tool handles, weapons, hut frames and nomadic tent posts, and picture frames.
Medicine: Leaves are used as an arbortifacient in Burkina Faso. Roots and leaves help in the treatment of pain in the intercostal area. Roots part of a remedy for chest complaints and colds, for gonorrhoea and female fertility, in poultice form they treat pustulous skin lesions, and they can be taken as tranquilizers. A decoction of roots is given on indication of delayed afterbirth to expel the placenta in humans, and sometimes cattle. Fruit taken for strength; wood said to be anthelmintic and bark used for boils and sores, inflammation of the intestines, syphilis, and as a vermifuge, diuretic and laxative. A decoction of the fruits makes an esteemed drink, a remedy for ‘igandi’ a deficiency disease.
Alcohol:  The fruit of G. bicolor can be fermented into beer and distilled into liquor.
Other services:  Twigs from the tree are used by water diviners to locate underground water."

Fruit is a drupe, 1-4 lobed, each lobe about 0.8 cm in diameter, olive green then black when ripe.

The genus was named after Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712), one of the founders of plant physiology.
Ecology

This is a tree of the subtropical climate. In its natural habitat, the maximum shade temperature seldom exceeds 38 deg. C and the minimum temperature rarely drops below –2 deg. C. It tolerates frost which is common during autumn and winter. The upper reaches receive light snowfall during January-February. Most of the rain is received during monsoon. Autumn and summer months are usually dry.
Native range
India
Tree management

Planting is done in July in pits dug in summer or at the beginning of the rainy season. Spacing is at 3 x 3 m for block planting and 4-5 m for single row planting along the fields. Plantation area should be protected against browsing, grazing and fire.

The tree requires complete overhead light for optimum growth. Severe frost causes die back in seedlings. The tree pollards and coppices well, whippy branches are lopped yearly for fodder and fibre.
There are 10 000-15 000 seeds/kg which can be stored for at least 1 year in the open without loss of viability. Fruits are rubbed and washed in water to remove the flesh. Each fruit contains 2-4 seeds.

It tolerates frost which is common during autumn and winter. The upper reaches receive light snowfall during January-February. Most of the rain is received during monsoon. Autumn and summer months are usually dry.
Propagation is mainly through nursery raised seedlings or stumps. Pre-sowing seed is necessary to hasten and improve germination as the seed testa is hard. Soaking seeds in cooling boiled water for 12 hours gives the best results. Seeds are sown in March, about 2 cm deep in lines 15 cm apart. About 250 g seed is required for each sq. m of nursery area. Seedbeds are irrigated after sowing until germination is complete. Seedlings grow fairly fast and attain plantable size by July. Stumps are also used and these are planted at 15 months. Seeds can be sown direct in the field provided they are watered during dry months.
  The ripe fruits are edible. Raw or cooked, it has a pleasant acid taste.
The leaves are rated as good fodder and trees are heavily lopped for this purpose in the winter months when usually no other green fodder is available. The green leaves constitute about 70 % of the total green weight of branches. Leaf fodder yield is reported to be 11 ton/ha from 2-year-old plants, green fodder yield from mature trees is reported to be 12-30 kg. Leaves are fairly rich in protein and other nutrients and do not contain tannins. Crude protein is highest in young leaves and in winter leaves but decreases during the rainy season.
The wood has an unpleasant odour and is, therefore seldom used as fuel if an alternative is available.
Fibre: The bark yields a fibre that is used for cordage and clothing.
Timber:  The wood, weighing 801 kg/cu. m, is whitish with little reddish-brown heartwood. It is fine textured with distinct growth rings. It is hard, tough with good elasticity and strength properties. It becomes difficult to work by hand after seasoning. The timber is used for oar shafts, poles, frames, tool handles and other purposes where strength and elasticity are required. It is thought to be suitable for paper production and branches are used for making baskets.
The tree is often planted in hedges and field boundaries.
Intercropping:  The tree is planted combined with climax grass."
Haematoxylum campechianum,"Local names:
 English (logwood,campeachy wood,bloodwood tree), French (bois bleu), Spanish (campeche)
Haematoxylum campechianum is a small bushy tree up to 15 m tall, but usually smaller, often thorny and gnarled; trunk irregularly fluted and contorted, attaining a length of 2-3 m and a diameter of 60 cm, although usually much less, prolonged into large, rather long and straight branches, bark grey to brown, rather smooth, peeling in flakes.  

Leaves alternate, paripinnate, distichous or fascicled on very short branches; stipules partly spine-like; leaflets in 2-4 pairs, obcordate or obovate, 10-35 mm x 5-25 mm, acute at base, emarginate at apex, closely veined and glabrous.

Flowers in 5-20 cm long racemes in the axils of present or fallen leaves, 5-merous, sweet-scented; calyx 4-5 mm long, deeply lobed; petals 5-7 mm long, bright yellow; stamens 10, free; ovary superior, shortly stalked, glabrous; style filiform. 

Fruit a lanceolate, extremely flattened pod, 3-5 cm long, pointed at both ends, dehiscent not along the sutures but along the median of the sides, usually 2-seeded.

Haematoxylum L. ('bloodwood') is a small genus with about 4 species.  It is indigenous to Central America and southern Africa.  In Central America 2 species are usually distinguished, both producing a dye in the wood.  Only H. campechianum has spread over most of the tropics.  In Central America logwood trees which do not produce haematoxylin have been found.  They are referred as 'bastard logwood'.
Ecology

Logwood is a lowland species which may grow under very different conditions.  In Central America it grows best in flat marshy areas often inundated by rivers.  In the West Indies, the best wood is common on exposed limestone hillsides in dry secondary thickets.
Native range
Tree management

Logwood grows slowly, but cultivation is easy.  With favourable growing conditions, the trees attain harvestable size in about 12 years.
 
Logwood is a lowland species which may grow under very different conditions.  In Central America it grows best in flat marshy areas often inundated by rivers.  In the West Indies, the best wood is common on exposed limestone hillsides in dry secondary thickets.
Logwood is propagated by seed or cuttings.
Apiculture: The flowers are the source of a very good honey.
The wood burns readily.
Timber: The wood is very hard and heavy, with an air-dry weight of 950-1085 kg/m.  The sapwood ring is thin, white or yellowish, and does not contain haematoxylin; heartwood turns bright reddish on exposure. It is compact, with interlocked grain and a coarse texture but fairly even.  It has an agreeable odour resembling violets, and a sweet astringent taste.  As timber its use is largely limited by the irregularity of the trunk.  The wood is strong but brittle; it is durable for use outdoors and in contact with the ground.  It is sometimes used for furniture and fancy articles because it may be finished to a very smooth surface and takes a high polish.
Tannin or dyestuff: The main product of the tree is the hearthwood; it is the logwood of commerce.  This wood yields a series of dyes in darker tints of grey, brown, violet, blue and black.  The dyes give a fairly permanent colour to several fabrics such as silk, wool, and sometimes cotton, but also to synthetics such as nylon and rayon.  They may be used to dye leather as well as fur, feathers, paper and bone, and also in the manufacture of inks.  Haematoxylin, the colouring agent of logwood, is a histological stain used for staining cell nuclei; alcoholic solutions serve as indicator for alkaloid titration.
Medicine: Medicinally it is a mild astringent and tonic, it is prescribed in the form of a decoction and liquid extract.  It is also useful against diarrhoea, dysentery, atonic dyspepsia and leucorrhoea.  An ointment prepared from the wood is said to be useful against cancer and hospital gangrene.  Haematoxylin has been shown to possess anti-flammatory properties.
Ornamental:  Logwood is grown in gardens for its delicate foliage and fragrant flowers.
In India and South-East Asia, logwood is occasionally cultivated as hedge plant."
Hagenia abyssinica,"Local names:
 Amharic (kosso), English (kousso,hagenia,cusso,brayera,African redwood), Swahili (mlozilozi,mdobore)
Hagenia abyssinica is a slender tree up to 20 m tall, with a short trunk and thick branches; branchlets covered in silky brown hairs and ringed with leaf scars. Bark thick, brown or reddish-brown and readily peeling. No thorns or buttresses.

Leaves compound, 40 cm long, in terminal tufts; leaflets pale or bright green above, with silvery hairs below, reddish and sticky when young, 3-6 pairs plus a terminal leaflet, each about 10 cm long; margin finely toothed and fringed with long hairs; leaf stalks 12 cm long, with expanded wings formed from the stipules, densely hairy on the underside.

Flowers in handsome multibranched, terminal, drooping panicles up to 60 cm long and 30 cm wide, polygamo-dioecious, female heads pinkish-red, clearly veined, bulkier than the more feathery orange-buff to white male heads.

Fruit small, dry, winged, asymmetric, single seeded, brown syncarp with a single more or less ovoid carpel and fragile pericarp.

Hagenia is a monospecific genus and is most closely related to the monospecific genus Leucosidea. The specific name means ‘from Ethiopia’.
Ecology

First described in Ethiopia and also found in East Africa, this tree is often dominant in the woodland zone just above the mountain bamboo. In Kenya, the species can be found on the slopes of Mt. Kenya, Mt. Elgon, the Aberdares, Cherangani Hills and the slopes of other high hills or mountains. It occurs in undifferentiated afro-montane forest (mixed Podocarpus forest, Juniperus-Podocarpus forest) and dry single dominant afro-montane forest (Juniperus forest or forest dominated by Hagenia), especially along the upper limit; often associated with Schefflera abyssinica, S. volkensii, Galiniera saxifraga, Rapanea melanophloës and with the mountain bamboo, Arundinaria alpina; at lower altitudes often at forest margins. This is a very clear example of an afro-montane endemic.
Native range
Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
Tree management

In Tanzania, trees are planted or wildings are allowed to grow, interspersed throughout a field at a density of about 10 trees/ha. To reduce light competition with crop and foster marketable bole development, the trees are pruned once each year in November, about two months before planting crops at the onset of the rainy season. Typically, annual prunings of mature trees remove 40-50% of the canopy height. Pollarding is also a suitable silvicultural practice.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; hermetic air-dry storage at cool temperatures is recommended. On average, there are 400 000-500 000 seeds/kg.

Pretreatment is not necessary and seeds germinate within 10-20 days of planting with a germination rate of 40-60%. Trees can also be regenerated from seedlings or wildings.
Erosion control: Trees are employed in soil-conservation activities.
H. abyssinica is a good source of firewood and charcoal.
Timber: Wood is dark red, medium soft but not durable; it is used for furniture, poles, flooring, carving and cabinet making.
Shade or shelter: The fire-resistant species can be used as a firebreak.
Medicine: The roots are cooked with meat and the soup drunk for general illness and malaria, while the dried and pounded female inflorescence is used as an anthelmintic (especially for tapeworm). Bark may be pounded, added to cold water and the liquid drunk as a remedy for diarrhoea and stomach-ache. Generally, this is a strong medicine that must not be taken in large quantities; it is sometimes taken as an abortifacient.
Ornamental: The attractive tree is suitable for planting in amenity areas.
Soil improver: Hagenia constantly sheds leaves, providing mulch and green manure.
Intercropping: In an experiment in Makete District Tanzania, grain yield of wheat was measured on eight different farms for a two-year period. The threshed wheat yield under a pruned H. abyssinica canopy averaged 810 kg/ha compared to 600kg/ha on parts of the field located at least 30 m from a tree."
Hardwickia binata,"Local names:
 Hindi (karachi,alti,anjan,kamra,yana,katt-udugu,parsid,ura), Nepali (papri), Sanskrit (anjan), Tamil (katudugu,acha,calam,ura,karacha), Trade name (chota-dundhera,anjan)
Hardwickia binata is a moderate-sized to large tree, up to 24-30 m tall, girth 1.8-3 m with a clean cylindrical bole up to 12-15 m; graceful, drooping slender branches; crown conical in early life, becoming broader later. Bark of saplings almost silvery white and smooth, gradually changing as the tree gets older to dark grey and rough with irregular vertical cracks, 1.2-2.5 cm thick, exfoliating in narrow flakes. In isolated situations, or on poor soils, the tree tends to branch low down and produce a short bole, but when grown in a fairly crowded crop on favourable soil it produces a long, straight, cylindrical bole with an elevated crown.

Leaves small, 2-6 cm long by 2-3 cm wide, alternate, pinnate, almost kidney shaped and greyish-green.

Flowers small, pale yellowish-green in axillary and terminal lax panicled racemes.

The pod flat and samaroid, 5-7.6 x 1-1.5 cm, oblong lanceolate, coriaceous, narrowed at both ends, with parallel longitudinal veins, containing 1 seed near the apex. The seed is exalbuminous, flat, averaging 0.8 x 0.3 in, in sub-reniform, pointed at one end and rounded at the other, with a fairly hard testa.
Ecology

Characteristically found in teak forests, dry savannah and degraded dry deciduous forests. The tree is distributed in isolated patches, varying in extent in the drier parts of the Indian Peninsula. Overlying soil does not have to be deep since the taproot has a capacity for growing through fissures in solid rock. H. binata thrives in a dry climate characterized by a long drought, scanty to moderate rainfall, and intense heat during the hot season. In the cold season, frosts, generally mild, occur only in certain portions of its area of distribution, particularly in low-lying areas. In its natural range, the seedlings are sensitive to drought, while frosts are not severe enough to do any harm. From the 2nd year onwards, they are immune to injury from frost. Young shoots are sensitive to fire, but recovery is good.
Native range
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

The tree thrives in a dry climate and is capable of establishing itself and growing on dry shallow soil and rocky ground where most other species would succumb. This is due partly to the early development of the taproot and the ability to penetrate hard soil and fissures in solid rock (the stem usually dying back annually during development of the taproot) and partly to its ability to withstand mutilation. Young trees can withstand some shade and may even require artificial shading. Later they are moderately light demanding. In heavily grazed areas the plant assumes a characteristic bushy form.

The tree pollards well even up to a comparatively advanced age, and old pollards when repollarded almost invariably produce abundant new shoots. However, the tree coppices poorly. Old trees, which send out vigorous pollard shoots if cut 1 or 2 m above the ground, produce no coppice shoots if cut flush with the ground; old pollards when felled at ground level never coppice.
Seed may sometimes retain viability for 1 or even 2 years.

Young shoots are sensitive to fire, but recovery is good.
H. binata has been propagated artificially both in and out of its natural habitat, partly by direct sowing and partly by transplanting seedlings, though it is generally agreed that the former is the more successful method.

Fresh mature seed has a high fertility rate and germinates readily with moderate moisture. Germination is epigeous. Growth and survival of seedlings are improved by mulching and shade.
Fodder: Leaves contain about 9% crude protein, but the amount varies with the age of the leaves.
H. binata provides excellent firewood and good charcoal.
Fibre: The bark yields a strong fibre largely employed for making ropes.
Timber: The wood is perhaps the hardest and heaviest in India. The sapwood is small and white, the heartwood dark reddish-brown streaked with purple; used for beams and mine props, bridge and house construction, agricultural implements, carts and wheel work. It is close grained, difficult to season but fairly durable.
Nitrogen fixing: A nodulating species, but there is considerable doubt about whether it is nitrogen fixing or not.
Soil improver: Branches are much lopped for manure; leaves can be used as mulch.
Intercropping: H. binata has a deep-rooting habit, hence competes minimally with arable crops."
Harungana madagascariensis,"Local names:
 Creole (blod tri), English (orange-milk tree,blood tree), Hausa (alillibar), Igbo (ururtu), Luganda (mulirira,mulilira), Swahili (ngoningoni,mgondogondo,mdamu mdamu,mbura,kumamaji), Yoruba (elepo)
Harungana madagascariensis is a small to medium sized bushy tree 4-7 m in height, sometimes reaching 10-25 m; it is much branched with a cylindrical trunk. Crown is golden-green, deep and spreading with fine almost whorled branches. Bole is often rather angular and forked. Bark greyish or red-brown rather rough and scaly, frequently vertically fissured, with very small vertically arranged scales which flake off easily; slash bright orange, thin, rather wet and turgid, but will peel off in long strips, and when cut, brilliant, almost florescent orange latex flows abundantly and by it, the tree can be recognized immediately. This orange paint-like sap exudes if leaves are snapped off or if branches are broken. Most parts of the tree are covered with fine stellate hairs. 

Leaves opposite, simple, ovate or ovate elliptic, 6-20 x 3-10 cm, glossy, dark green above with prominent veining, the under surface with dense rusty hairs which may be partially lost by maturity but usually persist, and rather numerous lateral nerves, which are prominent beneath; young leaves at the ends of branches are distinctive and remain tightly pressed together until quite large, the brown lower surfaces quite characteristic; apex tapering; base broadly tapering to rounded; margin entire; petiole 1.5-3 cm long.

Flowers whitish or cream, about 5 mm in diameter, sweetly almond scented, in dense many-flowered flat terminal heads (corymbose panicles), 8-20 cm in diameter, the stalks and calyx covered with short rusty hairs, bisexual; 5-merous; sepals glandular; petals with hairs on the inside and black gland dots; stamens in 5 clusters, each cluster made up of a few stamens joined for most of their length, with a sterile cluster, or a facsiclode between each fertile cluster; ovary 5-chambered.

Fruits berry-like (drupe), 2-4 mm in diameter, greenish-orange becoming red when mature, in heavy, massed, terminal heads up to 25-30 cm in diameter, rather dry, with a crustaceous pericarp enclosing the 5 pyrenes, 2-4 seeded.
Ecology

H. madagascariensis occurs at medium to low altitudes in evergreen forest, at forest margins and along river and stream banks. It is a common and widely distributed tree from the Sudan to South Africa, often a pioneer when a forest has been cleared. The species is widespread in tropical Africa, and is found in clearings in forest regions and fringing forest in savanna regions. It is found all over Sierra Leone in young farm bush, usually associated with Trema musanga and Nauclea latifolia. In Uganda, it is found in forest edges and in secondary scrub, and is usually associated with Maesopsis eminii and Trema orientalis. The trees have a general brownish-yellow appearance in the field

It  form dense thickets which excludes, other species and can possibly become a permanent component of tropical rainforests, potentially making it weedy.

Artificial propagation is carried out using seedlings and pre-sowing treatment is not necessary. Wildings can also be used, or seeds can be sown directly at the planting site. Seeds germinate soon after sowing, and germination is excellent resulting in a pure stand if sown in a prepared area, such as pots.
H. madagascariensis is a source of firewood and is used in the production of charcoal.
Timber:  The wood is pink, orange-red to yellow and can have most attractive colouring in larger specimens. The tree is not used commercially because it seldom grows to a merchantable size, though the rather light wood is used to make poles for building houses.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Sap extracted from the bark of orange-milk tree is used to dye palm leaves for making mats and other craft items.
Medicine:  Sap is used in the treatment of scabies and as an anthelmintic (tapeworms), while leaves are used as a remedy for hemorrhages, diarrhoea, gonorrhoea, sore throats, headaches and fevers. Resin from the flower stalks is believed to ease colic and to check infection after childbirth, while a decoction of the bark is drunk as a remedy for malaria or jaundice. Roots are used to hasten breast development in young women while roots and bark are boiled in water, and the infusion drunk twice a day, to interrupt the menses. Young leaves are sometimes used a medicine for asthma and fruits are occasionally used in cases of abortion in the belief that the red juice averts bleeding."
Hevea brasiliensis,"Local names:
 Amharic (yegoma zaf), Arabic (lastik barâ), Burmese (kyetpaung), English (rubber,caoutchouc tree,hevea,para rubber tree,rubber wood), French (caoutchouc  de para,hévéa,caoutchouc), German (heveakautschukbaum,Parakautschukbaum), Indonesian (kayu getah,pok
Hevea brasiliensis is a quick-growing tree, rarely exceeding 25 m in height in plantations, but wild trees of over 40 m have been recorded. Bole usually straight or tapered, branchless for 10 m or more, up to at least 50 cm in diameter, without buttresses; bark surface smooth, hoop marked, grey to pale brown, inner bark pale brown, with abundant white latex; crown conical, branches slender. Root system with a well-developed taproot and far-spreading laterals. 

Leaves alternate, palmate and each leaf with 3 leaflets. Leaflets elliptic petiolated, with a basal gland, pointed at the tip with lengths varying up to 45 cm; glabrous, with entire margin and pinnate venation.

Inflorescence in the form of pyramidal-shaped axillary panicles produced simultaneously with new leaves and arranged in cymose form. Flowers small, greenish-white, dioecious, female flowers usually larger than the male ones. In the female flower, gynaecium composed of 3 united carpels forming a 3-lobed, 3-celled ovary with a single ovule in each cell.

Seeds large, ovoid, slightly compressed, shiny, 2-3.5 x 1.5-3 cm, testa grey or pale brown with irregular dark brown dots, lines and blotches. The testa being derived from the female parent and the seed shape being determined by the pressures of the capsule, it is possible to identify the female parent of any seed by its markings and shape; this is the most reliable method of identifying clonal seed. Endosperm white in viable seeds, turning yellow in older seeds. Seeds weigh 2-4 g.

The generic name is derived from a local word in the Amazon, ‘heve’ meaning rubber.
Ecology

Rubber in the wild grows in the tropical evergreen rainforest of the Amazon Basin, often in periodically flooded areas, but larger trees are found on the well-drained plateaux. In its natural habitat, it forms part of the middle storey of the tropical forest.

Rubber is successfully cultivated under humid lowland tropical conditions, roughly between 15 deg. N and 10 deg. S, with comparatively little variation in temperature. Planting above 400-500 m is not recommended because trees at higher altitudes tend to be smaller, with less vigorous growth, and with reduced production of both latex and timber. In high-rainfall areas, good internal drainage of the soil is important. In some areas, rubber can tolerate a 2-3 month period of drought. Strong winds may snap trunks and branches; however, more wind-resistant clones do exist.
Native range
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela
Tree management

The area to be planted with rubber is cleared, lined and marked for roads and drainage. Planting pits are dug, 75 x 75 x 75 cm, or 90 x 90 x 90 cm, and filled with surface soil and manure. Weed control is a must in rubber plantations. It is preferable to establish a legume cover after transplanting in the field. Pruning to shape the trees and removal of the unwanted lateral suckers is essential. Mulching should be carried out just before the end of the late rains. Recommended fertilizers must be applied at the right time and at the recommended doses. The economic life cycle of a rubber plantation is 30-35 years, after which replanting is necessary.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant; viability can be maintained for 3 months in moist storage with moist charcoal and sawdust in a perforated polythene bag at 7-10 deg. C. Whole seed moisture content is 36%; lowest safe moisture content is 20%, and no seeds survive further desiccation to 15% mc. 

Seeds are killed on exposure to -5 deg. C for 3-4 hours. Commercial clonal seed are stored in cold storage at about 4 deg. C, which often gives reduced but tolerable germination.
Rubber in the wild grows in the tropical evergreen rainforest of the Amazon Basin, often in periodically flooded areas, but larger trees are found on the well-drained plateaux. In its natural habitat, it forms part of the middle storey of the tropical forest.

Rubber is successfully cultivated under humid lowland tropical conditions, roughly between 15 deg. N and 10 deg. S, with comparatively little variation in temperature. Planting above 400-500 m is not recommended because trees at higher altitudes tend to be smaller, with less vigorous growth, and with reduced production of both latex and timber. In high-rainfall areas, good internal drainage of the soil is important. In some areas, rubber can tolerate a 2-3 month period of drought. Strong winds may snap trunks and branches; however, more wind-resistant clones do exist.
Rubber can be propagated through seed or vegetatively. Seed are collected and sown fresh, as they lose viability rapidly (only 7-10 days). Usually 2 or more seeds per hole are planted, and then seedlings are selectively thinned, or the seeds are planted in a nursery. Seeds germinate in 1-3 weeks, depending on climatic conditions and freshness. Seedlings grow to 1-1.5 m in 6 months. 

Vegetative propagation is by budding or cuttings. Seedlings make good cuttings, but rubber-bearing trees take very poorly or not at all.
Poison: Kernel oil is effective against houseflies and lice.
 Although poisonous, seeds of rubber can be eaten as a famine food after processing, which involves prolonged soaking or boiling to remove the cyanic poisons. Some of the denser wild stands of rubber in the Amazon are said to be due to artificial enrichment by indigenous peoples to increase food supply. Seeds contain 40-50% oil, which dries well and is suitable for use as food and for technical purposes.
Fodder: Seeds are sometimes eaten off the ground by cattle. Press cake or extracted meal can be cautiously used as feed for stock.
Apiculture: So much nectar is secreted by the extra-floral nectaries that rubber is an important source of honey.
Rubberwood was formerly regarded as a byproduct of the rubber plantations and used for the production of charcoal or as fuelwood, for brick making, tobacco drying and rubber drying.
Fibre: Offcuts and other rubberwood residues have been used successfully in Malaysia for the production of particle board, wood-cement board, and medium-density fibreboard.
Timber: Heartwood pale cream, often with a pink tinge when fresh, darkening on exposure to pale straw-coloured or pale brown, not clearly demarcated from the sapwood. Grain straight to shallowly interlocked. Texture moderately coarse but even; sawn rubberwood often shows black stripes with the inclusion of bark material, the result of poor tapping practices with damaged or removed cambium; in freshly sawn wood there is a characteristic and distinct smell of latex. The importance of the timber from the rubber plantations is now fully recognized, and in Southeast Asia it is planted solely for timber production. Most of the timber is used to manufacture furniture. Other uses include interior finish, moulding, e.g. for wall panelling, picture frames, drawer guides, cabinet and other handles, parquet flooring, many household utensils, blockboard cores, pallets, crates, coffins, veneer, and glue-laminated timber, e.g. for staircases and door and window components. Since the timber is only moderately durable when exposed to the elements, it should not be used for exterior purposes.
Lipids: Seeds are the source of para rubber seed oil. Boiling removes the poison and releases the oil, which can be used for illumination. Kernels (50-60% of the seed) contain semi-drying pale yellow oil used in soap making, paints and varnishes.
Soil improver: Press cake or extracted meal can be used as fertilizer.
Intercropping: Intercropping with coffee or cocoa, perhaps in conjunction with ipecac, is possible. A fodder crop such as Cajanus might be tried for lac production instead of the usually recommended cover crops (e.g. Calopogonium, Centrosema, Flemingia, Psophocarpus, Pueraria). After a few years under legumes, no nitrogen fertilizer may be needed, but phosphorus, magnesium and potassium may be limiting in some areas.
Latex or rubber: Latex, the source of hevea or para rubber, is obtained by tapping the trunks of the trees. The latex coagulates with the aid of acetic acid, formic acid and alum. Cured rubber is used for all types of rubber products."
Hibiscus sabdariffa,"Local names:
 English (white sorrel,rozelle,roselle,red sorrel,jamaica), Malay (asam susur), Thai (kachieb priew)
Hibiscus sabdariffa is an erect, mostly branched, annual shrub. Stem reddish in colour and up to 3.5 m tall, with a deep penetrating taproot.

Leaves variously colored, dark green to red; leaves alternate, glabrous, long-petiolate, palmately divided into 3-7 lobes, with serrate margins.

Flowers large, short-peduncled, red to yellow with dark center. The accrescent large and fleshy sepals become enlarged and succulent, making excellent jelly.

Capsules ovoid, beaked and hairy 5 cm long, 5.3 cm wide.

Several cultivars are known, the best known are: 'Victor', 'Rico' and 'Archer'. Of the botanical varieties: var. sabdariffa, has red or pale yellow inflated edible calyces, but poor fiber; var. altissima is grown for its fiber, but has inedible calyces. There is a green form known as the white sorrel, with greenish-white fruits.
Ecology

H. sabdariffa tolerates a warm and humid tropical climate, and is susceptible to damage from frost and fog.
Native range
Angola, Egypt, Guatemala, Guinea, India, Myanmar, Nigeria, Philippines
Tree management

It is not shade tolerant and must be kept weed-free, weeding for the first month is important. Tolerate floods, heavy winds or stagnant water. Applications of stable manure or commercial fertilizers are beneficial, roselle responds favourably to applications of nitrogen, 45 kg/ha is recommended in India, applied in the form of compost or mineral fertilizer in conjunction with a small quantity of phosphate. In Java green manure from Mimosa invisa is plowed under before it starts to produce mature seeds. Also in Java the following fertilizer rates are recommended for roselle: 80 kg N/ha, 36–54 kg P 2O5/ha and 75–100 kg K 2O/ha. Yields for roselle in legume fallow plots are significantly high. Generally the crop should be ready for picking 5-6 months after planting or 15-20 days after flowering continuing for about 2 months. In Indonesia fiber is harvested is about 10 months from planting. When grown for its fiber, it is planted closely to produce long stems with little foilage.
H. sabdariffa tolerates a warm and humid tropical climate, and is susceptible to damage from frost and fog.
Seeds for home gardens of roselle are sown directly in rows. Soil preparation should be deep, about 20 cm, and thorough. Seed, 11–22 kg/ha depending upon the soil, is drilled about 15 cm x 15 cm at beginning of rainy season, mid-April in India, planting to a depth of about 0.5 cm. Broadcasting is not recommended because of uneven stand.
Poison:  H. sabdariffa is toxic to Schistosoma mansoni at 50-100 ppm, showing both miracidicidal and cercaricidal activity.
  Source of a red beverage known as ‘jamaica’ in Mexico. Calyx, called karkade in Switzerland, is used in jams, jellies, sauces, and wines. In the west Indies and elsewhere in the tropics the fleshy calyces are used fresh for making roselle wine, jelly, syrup, gelatin, refreshing beverages, pudding, and cakes, and dried roselle is used for tea, jelly, marmalade, ices, ice-cream, sherbets, butter, pies, sauces, tarts, and other desserts. Tender leaves and stalks are eaten as salad and a pot-herb. The leaves are used for seasoning curries and also consumed as vegetable.
Apiculture:  Flowers are a source of pollen and nectar for bees.
H. sabdariffa stem and wood are potential raw materials for charcoal making.
Fibre:  Roselle is cultivated primarily for the bast fiber obtained from the stems. The fiber strands, up to 1.5 m long, are used for cordage and as a substitute for jute in the manufacture of burlap.
Lipids:  Roselle seed oil is rich in linoleic acid and is a candidate source for vegetable oils.
Medicine:  The roselle is useful in arteriosclerosis. Reported to be antiseptic, aphrodisiac, astringent, cholagogue, demulcent, digestive, diuretic, emollient, purgative, refrigerant, resolvent, sedative, stomachic, and tonic, roselle is a folk remedy for abscesses, bilious conditions, cancer, cough, debility, dyspepsia, dysuria, fever, hangover, heart ailments, hypertension, neurosis, scurvy, and strangury. The drink made by placing the calyx in water, is said to be a folk remedy for cancer. Medicinally, leaves are emollient, and are much used in Guinea as a diuretic, refrigerant and sedative; fruits are antiscorbutic; leaves, seeds, and ripe calyces are antiscorbutic. In Myanmar, the seeds are used for debility and the leaves as emollient. Taiwanese regard the seed as diuretic, laxative and tonic. In Philippines the bitter root is used as an aperitive and tonic. Angolans use the mucilaginous leaves as an emollient and as a soothing cough remedy. Central Africans poultice the leaves on abscesses. Ingestion of the plant extract reportedly decreases the rate of absorption of alcohol.
Ornamental:  The roselle is a multiple-use species with beautiful flowers.
Intercropping: A crop rotation system of legume green-manure crop, roselle and then corn is recommended to limit the parasitic root-knot nematode, Heterodera radicicola."
Hippophae rhamnoides,"Local names:
 Danish (tindved), English (sea buckthorn), French (grisset,argousier,argasse), German (sanddorn), Lao (Sino-Tibetan) (star-bu,dhar-bu), Spanish (espino falso,espino armarillo), Swedish (finbar), Trade name (sea buckthorn)
Hippophaë rhamnoides is an arborescent armed, deciduous shrub or tree sometimes reaching up to 18 m. Crown irregular in shape with spiny, grey branches.

Leaves linear-lanceolate, alternate, 2-6 cm long, covered on both sides with silvery-white scales, undersides with brown dots.

Flowers inconspicuous, yellow, unisexual appearing before leaves.

Fruit a 1-seeded drupe, reddish orange, varying in length from 5-12 mm.

The ancient Greeks named the genus Hippophaë or ""glittering horse,"" its leaves were part of the diet for racing horses, and they also believed that horses became plump and healthy when maintained on pastures with these trees. According to another legend, sea buckthorn leaves were one of the preferred foods of the Pegasus (flying horse).

The species is distributed in more than 20 countries of Europe and Asia, and its morphological traits vary considerably according to this wide range of climatic conditions.
Ecology

Sea buckthorn is native to the temperate zones of Asia and Europe, where it is widely distributed. It is also well represented at higher altitudes in the sub-tropical zones of Asia. China has the largest area (920 000 ha) under Hippophaë of any country, and also the largest variety of Hippophaë species. Sea buckthorn grows on sand dunes near the sea to the Eurasian plateau at 5 200 m. However, they are extremely drought tolerant, with extensive root systems that scavenge soil humidity and groundwater aggressively.
Native range
China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Sweden
Tree management

Management varies according to objectives and environment factors. Sea buckthorn is a light-demanding species, trees growing in forested areas die if the canopy density exceeds 50%. However, its wide adaptability and varied reproductive strategies indicate it could be a serious weed in some environments. Its extensive, suckering root system may make it unsuitable for agroforestry technologies that include close tree/crop associations. Removal of six year old sea buckthorn plantations can produce 6.32 t/ha of wood. To ensure adequate pollination, orchards should have between 7-12% of the trees as pollinators. In China six year old sea buckthorn plantations can produce 6.32 t/ha of wood. Thorny stems and branches often make it difficult to harvest the fruits. Estimates of 1500 hours/hectare for fruit harvesting can be expected. Mechanical harvesters have been tried with little success, removing branches from the tree works well, but is still very labour intensive. Expected yields are around 5-7 kg per plant or 4-5 t/ha. Plants should be spaced between 1-4 m. An annual growth of 10-20 cm is estimated for this species.
With indoor storage seeds retain viability for 3-4 years. Under suitable conditions, they will germinate during any season of the year. In China plantation establishment has been successful by broadcasting seed from aircraft.
Sea buckthorn is native to the temperate zones of Asia and Europe, where it is widely distributed. It is also well represented at higher altitudes in the sub-tropical zones of Asia. China has the largest area (920 000 ha) under Hippophaë of any country, and also the largest variety of Hippophaë species. Sea buckthorn grows on sand dunes near the sea to the Eurasian plateau at 5 200 m. However, they are extremely drought tolerant, with extensive root systems that scavenge soil humidity and groundwater aggressively.
The species propagates well asexually because lignified branches of any age possess a strong ability to form adventitious roots. H. rhamnoides can also be propagated from softwood cuttings under mist. For introduction or breeding trials, seed propagation is the most suitable treatment. Seeds can be sown in autumn or stratified.
Sea buckthorn shows a strong tolerance for toxic pollutants in the soil and air. It can thus be used to revegetate heavily industrialized areas or to reclaim mining sites. With its hardy drought resisting attributes, this species is ideal for afforestating marginal areas.
Erosion control:  A good soil protector, useful for soil conservation, conserving water, and stabilizing sand dunes.
  The fruit is edible and has a tart, bittersweet taste. Sea buckthorn fruit is rich in vitamins C, E, K, B1 and B2, as well as niacinamide, pantothenic acid, carotenoids and other substances such as oil, sugar, malic acid, amino acids and pectin. The vitamin C content of the Chinese sea buckthorn subsp. sinensis fruit can be as high as 1253 mg/100 g-1. In China, peasants have become prosperous by collecting and processing the fruit. Hippophaë leaves also contain various nutritious substances and minerals. A nutritious herbal tea, (shaji tea) high in vitamin C and trace elements is made from hand picked, young and tender leaves of H. rhamnoides.
Herdsmen in northwest China often feed sea buckthorn leaves to their animals. In Russia, fodder supplements of sea buckthorn by-products are reported to improve liveweights and coat condition. Feeding poultry with meal made from sea buckthorn fruit and fruit oil has been observed to increase the pigmentation of egg yolks and body fat. The oil also increases flesh pigmentation in rainbow trout.
The tree yields good quality fuelwood.
Shade or shelter: H. rhamnoides is a shade provider.
Lipids:  A valuable natural oil, sea buckthorn oil (shaji oil) rich in vitamin C, E, carotene (vitamin A) and essential fatty acids is obtained from the seeds.
Medicine:  The plant is considered a general panacea and extensive use is made of its roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seed. Oil from the fruit acts as an antioxidant and may thus be used to treat wounds, frost bite and pathological problems of the alimentary mucous membranes. Serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine) extracted from sea buckthorn possesses antitumor capabilities.
Nitrogen fixing:  Hippophaë possesses a strong capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen in its root nodules when associated with the actinomycete, Frankia. Most soils possess enough Frankia to support nodulation. In one stand on the east coast of England, annual nitrogen fixation was estimated as high as 179 kg/ha-¹. All of the plant's characteristics, especially its strong nitrogen-fixing ability and rapid growth, make it a good species for improving soil fertility. In mixed plantings, it can promote the growth and development of adjacent plants.
Ornamental:  Sea buckthorn is also useful as an ornamental shrub.
It is used successfully as a windbreak and to stabilize sand dunes, and several of its products have high value.
Alcohol:  Sea buckthorn wine is well known in Russia where a new variety has been bred by hybridizing geographically distant plants."
Holarrhena floribunda,"Local names:
 English (false rubber tree)
Holarrhena floribunda is a shrub to medium sized tree, 4.5-15 m high.

Leaves shining, mostly ovate-acuminate, or ovate-lanceolate, 5-18 cm long and 2-8 cm broad with 6-12 pairs of lateral nerves.

Flowers white, scented and in almost umbel-like inflorescences; corolla-tube 5-9 mm long and lobes 3.5-8 mm and overlapping to the right. Anthers fertile to the base.

Paired narrowly cylindrical fruiting follicles, 30-60 cm, with seeds having apical tufts of hair.

Two varieties are recognized; var. floribunda with glabrous or almost glabrous leaves even when young and var. tomentella with densely pubescent leaves. The latter is common in the Sudan and Gambia.

The generic epithet Holarrhena is derived from Greek meaning complete male, whereas the specific epithet refers to its prolific flowering trait.
Ecology

Occurs in relic deciduous, closed woodland forests, sometimes in fringing and riverine forest and on inselbergs in northern guinea savanna.
Natural regeneration is mainly by seed. Hairy roots were induced by inoculation of in vitro cultured seedlings, with the aim of increasing alkaloid biosynthesis. The percentage of plantlets forming hairy roots has been found to be 43% from experiments (Belalia et al. 1989).
Poison:  Most members of the family Apocynaceae are poisonous, therefore H. floribunda material should be handled carefully especially for medicinal purposes.
Timber:  Timber widely used to construct granaries or cribs in Benin. Its white wood is resistant to attack by Prostephanus truncatus. H. floribunda is considered the best for carving native stools.
Medicine:  Stem bark of H. floribunda is used in traditional medicine to treat malaria, dysentery, fever, female sterility, skin infections venereal diseases and snake bites. In Nigeria, convulsion, especially in children, is managed by traditional healers employing leaf extracts of H. floribunda. Fractions containing saponins, polar steroidal glycosides, steroidal glycosides and alkaloids exhibited some antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The saponin fraction markedly inhibited growth of Aspergillus niger.  Conessine, an alkaloid from stem and root bark of H. floribunda, has been used as an amoebicide antidysenteric and febrifuge.
Ornamental:  It flowers prolifically and can therefore be an ideal ornamental tree.
Latex or rubber:  A rubber like product obtained from this plant is used to adulterate genuine rubber."
Hopea odorata,"Local names:

Hopea odorata is a medium-sized to large evergreen tree with a large crown growing to 45 m tall, bole straight, cylindrical, branchless to 25 m, with diameter of up to 4.5 m or more and prominent buttresses, bark surface scaly, grey to dark brown, longitudinally furrowed, yellow or reddish inside.

Leaves ovate-lanceolate, 7-14 by 3-7 cm, falcate, base broadly cuneate, venation scalariform, midrib applanate to slightly channeled above, glabrous on both surfaces, petiole 2 cm long, slender.

Flowers small, sweet scented, yellowish-white, very shortly pedicelled, in one-sided racemes, stamens 15, anthers narrowly ellipsoid, ovary ovoid, punctate or glabrous.

Fruit small, ovoid, wings oblanceolate, rounded, 3-4 cm long, finely veined lengthwise.

The specific epithet means odour and refers to the sweet smell of the flowers.
Ecology

H. odorata is a riparian species usually occurring on deep rich soils, most commonly along the banks of streams and in damp situations up to 600-m altitude. It is chiefly found in the Andamans, in moist tropical evergreen forests and occurs sporadically in pure groups, but is not gregarious over large areas. In Myanmar, it occurs in moist tropical forests.
Native range
Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Germination rate has been found to be 73% in unshaded beds, 83% in shaded beds and 40% in direct field sowings. Generally, a shade crop is grown to protect the young seedlings from the first hot weather and to keep weeds down. The young plants need full overhead light and the shade crop should be cut back periodically to ensure it does not overtop the tree. Weeding, occasional watering and loosening of the soil around the plants is recommended in the nursery. Dibbling is done at an espacement of 7.5 by 7.5 cm. About 70g of seed is enough for a sq. m of nursery bed.
There are about 3 000-4 600 seeds/kg. Seeds are recalcitrant and die within five days due to dehydration. If dried at 35 deg. C to 33 % moisture content, seeds could stay viable for 1-2 months at 15 deg. C, maintaining a germination rate of over 60 %. If stored at 4 deg. C, the seeds can stay viable for about three months.

It is chiefly found in the Andamans, in moist tropical evergreen forests and occurs sporadically in pure groups, but is not gregarious over large areas. In Myanmar, it occurs in moist tropical forests.
Natural regeneration springs up profusely round the mother trees. To encourage natural reproduction, the overhead canopy should be thinned or removed. In Indonesia, bare root transplanting results in almost 100 % survival if seedlings are root pruned first. Germination takes place in 1-4 weeks. The seeds are collected from the ground under the seed bearers and they can also be collected by lopping small branches. Direct sowing, entire transplanting and stump planting are all successful. For regeneration operations very light seeds should be rejected.
The species is used for reforestation in Southeast Asia.
Timber: The sapwood is pale yellow or greyish yellow turning pale brown on exposure, heartwood yellowish-brown to brownish red sometimes with dark streaks, turning purplish on exposure, with lustrous white resin canals at irregular intervals, becoming dull with age. The wood is very hard and heavy weighing 755-kg/cu m, difficult to saw but finishes well. It is chiefly used for boat-building, dug-out canoes and for construction purposes, where durability and strength are of primary importance. It is also used for carts, presses flooring, roofing, piles, fence-posts, ploughs, furniture, etc. It is a first class sleeper wood. 
Shade or shelter: The tree is sometimes used to provide shade.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The leaves, bark and wood contain 11, 13-15, and 10% tannin respectively, and are used for tanning.
Medicine: The dammar is applied on sores and wounds. In Indo-China, the bark is used as a masticatory.
Gum or resin:  The tree yields a resin known as rock dammar in commerce, which the Burmese use to caulk boats, in painting pictures and in preparation of varnishes. A composition prepared by mixing the resin with bees-wax and red ochre is used for fasteni"
Hyeronima alchorneoides,"Local names:
 English (bully tree,suradan pilon), Portuguese (urucurana mirim,urucurana de leite,aricurqua,sangue-de-boi,licurana,mará-goncalo,marconcal,aricurana,muiragonçalo), Spanish (pilón,cargamanto,casaco,nancitón,pantano,zapatero,sangre de toro,trompillo,palo c
Hyeronima alchorneoides is a tall dioecious tree of lowland tropical forests up to 50 m tall and diameter of 1-1.2 m with multiple, orthotropic branches that form a dense crown. The bole tend to be straight, robust, with very little taper, and un-branched up to a height of 20 m or more. Bark smooth, distinctive deep reddish-brown on the outside, pinkish on the inside and bitter-tasting.

Leaves simple, alternate, petiolate, entire, 5-9 cm long, very variable in shape, with large, leafy stipules and abundant peltate hairs on both surfaces. Young leaves green, later turning yellow and nearly red before shedding.

Flowers small and inconspicuous, yellow-green, zygomorphic, arranged on 5 cm long axillary-branched panicles

Fruit a small, one-seeded drupe, 2.5-5.5 mm in diameter, red or dark purple at maturity

Seed very small, surrounded by the stony endocarp, endosperm oily and large embryo.


H. alchorneoides is one of 36 species in the genus Hyeronima (also known as Hieronyma), all of which are indigenous to Central and South America. The species exhibits a wide range of intra-specific variation. Two of the characters most commonly used to identify the tree include leaf size and the presence or absence of stipules. This varies among individuals and even within the same individual, depending on shoot phenology and age.
Ecology

H. alchorneoides is a massive canopy emergent tree of lowland humid and very humid mixed tropical forests, which are sometimes waterlogged during the rainy season.
Native range
Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, St Lucia, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela
Tree management

Site preparation prior to stand establishment usually involves site clearing. Potted seedlings transplanted with their nursery substrate and fertilizer applied to the bottom of the planting hole perform better. In Costa Rica, a spacing of 3 x 3 m is used to establish a plantation but 2 x 2 m can also be used. Fertilizer application and weeding in the first 12 months after planting out from the nursery have significant positive effects. First pruning is recommended at 9-12 months while thinning after 3-4 years. Thinned stumps are known to re-sprout, but the resulting root systems tend to be weak.

Trees show good growth and form, and have ability to self-prune. A high shade tolerance by lower leaves make the species compatible for planting in mixed species plantations, where H. alchorneoides forms the lower stratum in a stratified canopy. In monocultures, H. alchorneoides achieves 90% interception of incoming solar radiation at 2 years of age suppressing understorey regeneration.
It is best to collect the fruits from the tree by cutting down branches. The fruits are small and therefore it is useful to put tarpaulins on the ground under the tree. The fruits are collected when they have changed from green to red, indicating maturity. Once mature, the fruits start to fall and often there are only 3-4 days to carry out the collection

The fruits can be de-pulped although this is not done in many places. The seed storage behaviour is intermediate. The seeds are tolerant to desiccation and low temperatures, and should be stored at low moisture content in airtight bags in a cold. There are about 26000 seeds/kg.
H. alchorneoides is a massive canopy emergent tree of lowland humid and very humid mixed tropical forests, which are sometimes waterlogged during the rainy season.
H. alchorneoides is usually propagated by seeds and pseudo-cuttings. Best germination can be achieved by washing seeds in water and lightly sanding them or by applying gibberrellic acid. Germination begins after 25-30 days and is complete in about 60 days after sowing. The seeds of this species are sensitive to light and do not germinate in a cabinet with artificial light. Under greenhouse conditions, the seeds are sown in boxes filled with sand and after germination the seedlings are transferred to polytubes and placed in the shade. Transplanting must be done carefully as the roots are fragile.

The preparation of pseudo-stakes is done using seedlings once their stems are sufficiently lignified. Seedlings are uprooted, and the roots and shoots pruned back to 15 and 10 cm, respectively. Pseudo-stakes require 5-6 months in the nursery before they are ready for planting. Plantation establishment using pseudo-stakes requires managing of re-sprouts in the early phase of establishment.
H. alchorneoides is among several species that have shown potential for growth on a variety of soils, indicating its suitability for use in re-vegetation of degraded lands. This species has a relatively high allocation to fine roots, making it less likely to experience nutrient limitation under low-fertility conditions. In addition to its tolerance to infertile soils, it grows on acid soils and has a high tolerance for exchangeable aluminium.
Timber: H. alchorneoides has a reddish-brown heartwood, and sapwood with a lighter colour and pinkish hue. The wood specific gravity ranges from 0.59-0.86. It is suitable for heavy construction, including railway sleepers, bridges, columns and beams, fence posts, stakes, piles and in marine construction. In addition, it is used for furniture, cabinetwork, flooring, decorative veneers, turnery and joinery. It is durable and fairly resistant to termites but difficult to impregnate and prone to decomposition, especially below ground
Medicine: The seeds of H. alchorneoides contain oil that is effective against intestinal parasites (anti-helminthic). In Guyana, a decoction of the bark is used for its anti-tussive properties.
Soil improver: H. alchorneoides has a role in soil amelioration that may lead to an increase in soil organic carbon from to its large litter production"
Hymenaea courbaril,"Local names:
 Chamorro (kawanari), Creole (gòm anime,koubari,courbaril), Dutch (rode lokus), English (Brazilian cherry,Brazilian copal,cayenne copal,copal,demarara copal,kerosene tree,stinking toe,Latin American locust), French (gomme animée,pois confiture), Portugues
Hymenaea courbaril is a tree usually 30-40 m high, sometimes reaching 50 m in high forest; trunk up to 2 m in diameter, bark usually smooth, greyish, 1-3 cm thick and red internally; in the forest branching 10-20 m above ground level, much lower in exposed sites, crown wide and open or dense; root system fairly superficial with large roots often seen on the surface. 

Leaves alternate, compound, bifoliate; stipules soon falling; petiole 12-30 mm long; leaflets 2, ovate to lanceolate, curving slightly towards each other, 3-12 x 1.5-7 cm, apex acute to obtuse, base oblique, margins entire, glabrous, shiny and leathery with small glands and prominent veins below, petiolules 2-8 mm long.

Inflorescence a short, terminal panicle with few branches and flowers; flowers bisexual; pedicles 3-10 mm long. Sepals 4, concave, oblong-obovate, 12-22 mm long, stamens 10, filamentous, anthers 3-8 mm long, ovary 1-locular, ovules 6-18 or more. 

Fruit an indehiscent oblong pod, 8-15 x 3-5 cm, pericarp dull dark brown, hard, woody, about 5 cm thick; seeds 1-6, light to dark brown, hard, flattened, obovoid to ellipsoid, 1-2 cm long, surrounded by a dry, creamy brown or greenish pulp. Pods weigh 10-50 g and the pulp accounts for less than 20% of this weight.
Ecology

H. courbaril occupies a wide range of habitats. It has been reported in tropical dry forest, transition to premontane moist forest, and tropical wet forest as well as subtropical moist forest. Tolerates not only poor fertility and waterlogging but also 4 months or more of drought, with temperatures typical of the wet lowland tropics, that is, diurnal temperature fluctuations are normally greater than seasonal temperature changes. The precipitation may be evenly distributed through the year or monsoonal. The tree develops best on ridges or slopes and high riverbanks.
Native range
Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela
Tree management

H. courbaril seedlings grow at an angle with a drooping leader, a habit that may persist for 2 or 3 years. Open planting sites and good weed control until the seedlings reach about 2 m is important for best planting stock. Rate of growth is steady, and yields are large with some trees capable of producing several thousand pods a year. Considering the tree is a hardwood, seedling growth is rapid and under 50% shade reaches a height of about 78 days after germination. Trees may reach a height of 8 m in 5 years and 18.5 m in 16 years. The species is intolerant to shade when mature. Planting in the open, for shade and ornamental purposes, produces attractive and spreading trees more rapidly. H. courbaril coppices well and thus maintains itself in frequently cut-over areas; however stumps of large trees do not coppice.
Seeds germinate in 20-30 days with 40-90% success. Scarification of seeds by nicking or soaking for 1 hour in concentrated sulphuric acid increases germination percentage and reduces germination time. Orthodox seed storage behaviour; seeds can be stored for as long as 12 months in dry conditions with little loss of viability. Seeds that are to be stored for more than 1 year should be refrigerated at 2-4 deg. C in a sealed container; germination following 2 years in hermetic air-dry storage at 3-5 deg. C was 29%. There are approximately 270 seeds/kg.
H. courbaril occupies a wide range of habitats. It has been reported in tropical dry forest, transition to premontane moist forest, and tropical wet forest as well as subtropical moist forest. Tolerates not only poor fertility and waterlogging but also 4 months or more of drought, with temperatures typical of the wet lowland tropics, that is, diurnal temperature fluctuations are normally greater than seasonal temperature changes. The precipitation may be evenly distributed through the year or monsoonal. The tree develops best on ridges or slopes and high riverbanks.
Seeds for planting are most easily obtained by collecting and shelling the freshly fallen pods. Germination of the seed is epigeous. The species can be established using top-pruned, bare-root stock or containerized seedlings. Direct seeding is also feasible. Can be propagated vegetatively by using unlignified cuttings in misted beds with steam or electrically heated soil.
 Seed pods contain an edible powdery pulp. This pulp contains 3.2% sugar, 1.1% fat, and 35.8% crude fibre. It has its own peculiar smell and sweet flavour, slightly reminiscent of bananas, and is generally considered pleasant but not very attractive. The texture is that of dry flour turning to a paste in the mouth, and some people find this unpleasant. It is very dry and largely starchy, so it is a good source of calories. Jatoba bark tea is a quite popular drink for lumberjacks working in the forests in Brazil, because it is a natural energy tonic.
Fodder: The pods and leaves are not eaten. The seeds and pulp are removed from the pod, ground and readily consumed by livestock.
Timber: The hard, durable, tough wood is one of the best from the region. Heartwood is salmon pink to orange-brown when fresh, becoming russet to reddish-brown when seasoned; often marked with dark streaks. Sapwood is usually wide, white, grey, or pinkish. Texture is medium to rather coarse; grain mostly interlocked; golden lustre, without distinctive odour or taste. The wood is moderately difficult to saw and machine, largely because of its high density, but except in planing it can be machined to a smooth surface. It is easy to glue and finish satisfactorily. Wood very resistant to brown-rot and white-rot fungi. Heartwood is also rated very resistant to dry-wood termites; it has little resistance to marine borers. This important timber tree is used for furniture (sometimes compared with mahogany), carpentry, general construction, wheels and cogs, dugouts, shipbuilding, posts, looms, cartwheels and rail ties. The wood is also attractive for cabinetwork, musical instruments, interior trim, plywood, turnery, and veneer. 
Shade or shelter: A suitable species when planted as a shade tree and has occasionally been used for coffee shade. 
Tannin or dyestuff: The thick bark is a good source of tannin.
Medicine: The bark is common in local folk medicine as a cure-all, being especially useful for coughs. Besides being used to give energy and stamina, jatobá tea has been used for centuries as a tonic for the respiratory and urinary systems by the indigenous people of the Amazon Basin. Jatobá is known for its ability to fight fungus and yeast such as Candida albicans. Macerated bark is used for diarrhoea. The bark, sap or resin, and leaves are used medicinally for cystitis, hepatitis, prostatitis and cough. The sap is used for coughs and bronchitis, and a bark tea is used for stomach problems as well as athlete’s foot and foot fungus. In Brazilian herbal medicine today, jatobá bark and resin are still recommended for the same indications and problems as they have been since the 1930s, documented to be tonic, stomachic, astringent, balsamic, vermifuge, and haemostatic. The fruit is used to treat mouth ulcers, and the leaves and wood are used for diabetes.
Gum or resin: The roots and trunk yield a pale yellow or red resinlike gum known commercially as South American copal. The gum exudes and forms hard lumps that become buried in the soil at the base of a tree. Sometimes as much as a barrel of gum has been 
Ornamental: H. courbaril is used to some extent as an ornamental in parks and gardens."
Hymenocardia acida,"Local names:
 Bemba (kapempe), French (digbe,coeurs-volants), Luganda (nabaluka)
Hymenocardia acida is a small savannah tree or shrub about 9 m high. Branchlets become rusty brown as the bark peels. The bole is short, often flattened and usually crooked. The branches form a fairly heavy, somewhat rounded crown. Bark smooth or flaky, pinkish-brown when fresh but becoming pale brown or grey later.

Leaves thin, leathery, elliptic-oblong up to 8.75 cm long and 3.75 cm broad, apex obtuse to rounded, base obtuse; petiole slender, up to 1.8 cm long. Leaves usually pubescent when young with a dense mat of fine hairs and with golden glands beneath. 

Flowers unisexual, male flowers reddish-yellow occurring in clusters of spikes up to 6.5 cm long; calyx cupular, red, anthers creamy white. Female flowers green, placed on axils of leafy lateral branches and bearing a prominent crimson stigma spreading about 1.25 cm.

Fruit compressed, obcordate and reddish-brown, 2.5 cm long and 2.5-3.75 cm broad. Developing in pairs along one edge, each with a thin pale brown nearly square wing.

Seed flattened, glossy brown.

The generic name Hymenocardia is derived from the Greek words ‘hymen’ - membrane and ‘kardia ’- heart, in reference to the heart-shaped fruits which have a transparent covering membrane (hymen). The specific epithet acida describes the sour taste of its fruits. Some authors consider the genus under the family Hymenocardiaceae.
Ecology

H. acida is commonly found in savannah, scrub and open woodland in association with Parinari curatellifolia, Isoberlinia, Stereospermum kunthianum, Parkia clappertoniana and Protea madiensis. Dry seasons last long in its natural range.

Apiculture:  The flowers provide nectar and pollen to bees.
The tree is used as firewood and for charcoal making.
Timber:  The sapwood is ivory-white and the heartwood pink to light-brown darkening to orange on exposure. The wood is hard, close grained, very durable and termite resistant. Used for hut poles, stockades, and for making pestles and mallets.
Shade or shelter:  H. acida is a good shade tree.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark is used for tanning in central Africa.
Medicine:  Tannins from H. acida stem bark are used to treat diarrhoea and dysentery and show good activity. In Zambia the bark is used in concoctions as remedy for an unspecified disease condition, in east Africa the plant is used in treating wounds. Root bark extracts exhibited cytotoxicity against the 60 human cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). H. acida extracts demonstrated a marked antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae.
Soil improver:  The leaf litter ameliorates soil physical and chemical properties.
Intercropping: H. acida casts a moderately light shade which is unlikely to fully deprive other crops of essential light.
Other services:  H. acida is used magically for psychosocial ailments."
Hyphaene thebaica,"Local names:
 Amharic (zembaba), Arabic (dom), English (gingerbread palm,Egyptian doum palm,doum palm), French (palmier doum), Swahili (mkoma), Tigrigna (kambash,arkobkobai)
Hyphaene thebaica is a deciduous palm 10-17 m high, with a girth of 90 cm. Trunk is Y-shaped, and the tree is easily recognizable by the dichotomy of its stem forming up to 16 crowns. Bole fairly smooth but clearly showing the scars of the fallen leaves. Bark dark grey.

Leaves 120 x 180 cm, fan shaped, in tufts at the ends of branches with the blade divided into segments about 60 cm long, margins entire; leaf stalk about 60 cm long, armed with curved thorns; petiole more than 1 m long, sheathing at the base with numerous upwardly curving hooks.

Male and female flowers on separate trees. The inflorescence is similar in both sexes, up to 1.2 m long, with short branches at irregular intervals and 2-3 spikes arising from each branch. Male flowers shortly stalked, solitary in pits of the spadix, spathe-bracts encircling the spadix, pointed. Branches of female spadices stouter, in the fruiting stage marked by densely tomentose cushions after the fall of the fruit.

The female palm produces woody fruits that persist on the tree for a long time. They are 6-10 x 6-8 cm, smooth, rectangular to cubical, with rounded edges, shiny brown when ripe, about 120 g each when fresh, 60 g when dry, each containing a single seed. Seeds 2-3.5 x 3 cm, ivory in colour, trunkate at base, apex obtuse.

Hyphaene is derived from the Greek word ‘hyphaino’ (web), referring to the fibres from the leaves, which are used for weaving.
Ecology

H. thebaica is one of the 11 species of the genus found in Africa. Widespread in the Sahel, it grows from Mauritania to Egypt, from Senegal to Central Africa and east to Tanzania. The tree tends to grow close to groundwater but can also grow farther away. It is also found in parts of the Sahara where water occurs, in oases and wadis, and is widely distributed near rivers and streams, sometimes on rocky slopes. It does not do well in waterlogged areas; it is very resistant to bush fires. Trees occur on silty soils on river and stream banks and on rocky hilly slopes throughout the Sudan.
Native range
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo
Tree management

Growth is known to be relatively slow, and after germination a single strip-shaped leaf is produced, with fan-shaped leaves being produced at ground level 2-3 years after germination. At this stage, a new leaf is produced every 7 days and the stem is produced after 18-20 years. This fire-resistant species is managed by coppicing and lopping. Mature trees of 6-8 years produce 50 kg of fruit/year. Palm trees that are tapped for production of wine need to be protected from browsing camels.
Seed storage behaviour is uncertain.

It does not do well in waterlogged areas; it is very resistant to bush fires. Trees occur on silty soils on river and stream banks and on rocky hilly slopes throughout the Sudan.
Seeds are sown directly, and after 5-6 months they send out very long roots. It is best if the outer seed covering is removed and then the seed planted about 20 cm deep. Soil needs to be kept moist for 2-3 months to ensure germination; after that, the palm can be considered established and can tolerate up to 10 months of drought. It is also possible to establish trees from suckers growing on the mother tree, but these usually require a longer period of watering. Rhizomes can also be used to regenerate plants.
Erosion control: Doum palm is grown on river banks to stabilize them.
 The covering of the fruit is edible and can either be pounded to form a powder or cut off in slices; the powder is often dried then added to food as a flavouring agent. Young shoots produce tasty palm cabbage; the hypocotyl is edible, and so are the immature seeds if well prepared.
Fodder: Trees are browsed to a limited extent by livestock, especially in dry periods.
Palms are occasionally used for firewood and charcoal; leaves may also be used as fuel.
Fibre: Leaves are probably the most important part of the palm, providing the raw material used in basketry, making mats, brooms, coarse textiles, ropes, thatching and string. Root fibres obtained after 2-3 days of soaking and beating of the roots are used for making fishing nets.
Timber: Wood can be cut using an axe, but is difficult to saw due to the many fibres that constitute the wood. Timber from the male palm is said to be better than that from the female, as it is borer and termite proof, decorative and durable. It is often used for construction, providing supports and rafters for houses, water ducts and wheels, railway sleepers, planks, fence posts and raft construction.
Tannin or dyestuff: Dried bark is used to produce a black dye for leatherwear.
Medicine: Roots are used in the treatment of bilharzia, while fruit pulp is chewed to control hypertension. Sore eyes in livestock are treated using charcoal from the seed kernel.
Alcohol: In Turkana, Kenya, the powder made from the outer covering of the fruit is added to water and milk and left to stand to make a mild alcoholic drink; in other countries, the terminal meristem is tapped for making palm wine."
Haematoxylum campechianum,"Local names:
 English (logwood,campeachy wood,bloodwood tree), French (bois bleu), Spanish (campeche)
Haematoxylum campechianum is a small bushy tree up to 15 m tall, but usually smaller, often thorny and gnarled; trunk irregularly fluted and contorted, attaining a length of 2-3 m and a diameter of 60 cm, although usually much less, prolonged into large, rather long and straight branches, bark grey to brown, rather smooth, peeling in flakes.  

Leaves alternate, paripinnate, distichous or fascicled on very short branches; stipules partly spine-like; leaflets in 2-4 pairs, obcordate or obovate, 10-35 mm x 5-25 mm, acute at base, emarginate at apex, closely veined and glabrous.

Flowers in 5-20 cm long racemes in the axils of present or fallen leaves, 5-merous, sweet-scented; calyx 4-5 mm long, deeply lobed; petals 5-7 mm long, bright yellow; stamens 10, free; ovary superior, shortly stalked, glabrous; style filiform. 

Fruit a lanceolate, extremely flattened pod, 3-5 cm long, pointed at both ends, dehiscent not along the sutures but along the median of the sides, usually 2-seeded.

Haematoxylum L. ('bloodwood') is a small genus with about 4 species.  It is indigenous to Central America and southern Africa.  In Central America 2 species are usually distinguished, both producing a dye in the wood.  Only H. campechianum has spread over most of the tropics.  In Central America logwood trees which do not produce haematoxylin have been found.  They are referred as 'bastard logwood'.
Ecology

Logwood is a lowland species which may grow under very different conditions.  In Central America it grows best in flat marshy areas often inundated by rivers.  In the West Indies, the best wood is common on exposed limestone hillsides in dry secondary thickets.

Tree management

Logwood grows slowly, but cultivation is easy.  With favourable growing conditions, the trees attain harvestable size in about 12 years.
 
Logwood is a lowland species which may grow under very different conditions.  In Central America it grows best in flat marshy areas often inundated by rivers.  In the West Indies, the best wood is common on exposed limestone hillsides in dry secondary thickets.
Logwood is propagated by seed or cuttings.
Apiculture: The flowers are the source of a very good honey.
The wood burns readily.
Timber: The wood is very hard and heavy, with an air-dry weight of 950-1085 kg/m.  The sapwood ring is thin, white or yellowish, and does not contain haematoxylin; heartwood turns bright reddish on exposure. It is compact, with interlocked grain and a coarse texture but fairly even.  It has an agreeable odour resembling violets, and a sweet astringent taste.  As timber its use is largely limited by the irregularity of the trunk.  The wood is strong but brittle; it is durable for use outdoors and in contact with the ground.  It is sometimes used for furniture and fancy articles because it may be finished to a very smooth surface and takes a high polish.
Tannin or dyestuff: The main product of the tree is the hearthwood; it is the logwood of commerce.  This wood yields a series of dyes in darker tints of grey, brown, violet, blue and black.  The dyes give a fairly permanent colour to several fabrics such as silk, wool, and sometimes cotton, but also to synthetics such as nylon and rayon.  They may be used to dye leather as well as fur, feathers, paper and bone, and also in the manufacture of inks.  Haematoxylin, the colouring agent of logwood, is a histological stain used for staining cell nuclei; alcoholic solutions serve as indicator for alkaloid titration.
Medicine: Medicinally it is a mild astringent and tonic, it is prescribed in the form of a decoction and liquid extract.  It is also useful against diarrhoea, dysentery, atonic dyspepsia and leucorrhoea.  An ointment prepared from the wood is said to be useful against cancer and hospital gangrene.  Haematoxylin has been shown to possess anti-flammatory properties.
Ornamental:  Logwood is grown in gardens for its delicate foliage and fragrant flowers.
In India and South-East Asia, logwood is occasionally cultivated as hedge plant."
Hagenia abyssinica,"Local names:
 Amharic (kosso), English (kousso,hagenia,cusso,brayera,African redwood), Swahili (mlozilozi,mdobore)
Hagenia abyssinica is a slender tree up to 20 m tall, with a short trunk and thick branches; branchlets covered in silky brown hairs and ringed with leaf scars. Bark thick, brown or reddish-brown and readily peeling. No thorns or buttresses.

Leaves compound, 40 cm long, in terminal tufts; leaflets pale or bright green above, with silvery hairs below, reddish and sticky when young, 3-6 pairs plus a terminal leaflet, each about 10 cm long; margin finely toothed and fringed with long hairs; leaf stalks 12 cm long, with expanded wings formed from the stipules, densely hairy on the underside.

Flowers in handsome multibranched, terminal, drooping panicles up to 60 cm long and 30 cm wide, polygamo-dioecious, female heads pinkish-red, clearly veined, bulkier than the more feathery orange-buff to white male heads.

Fruit small, dry, winged, asymmetric, single seeded, brown syncarp with a single more or less ovoid carpel and fragile pericarp.

Hagenia is a monospecific genus and is most closely related to the monospecific genus Leucosidea. The specific name means ‘from Ethiopia’.
Ecology

First described in Ethiopia and also found in East Africa, this tree is often dominant in the woodland zone just above the mountain bamboo. In Kenya, the species can be found on the slopes of Mt. Kenya, Mt. Elgon, the Aberdares, Cherangani Hills and the slopes of other high hills or mountains. It occurs in undifferentiated afro-montane forest (mixed Podocarpus forest, Juniperus-Podocarpus forest) and dry single dominant afro-montane forest (Juniperus forest or forest dominated by Hagenia), especially along the upper limit; often associated with Schefflera abyssinica, S. volkensii, Galiniera saxifraga, Rapanea melanophloës and with the mountain bamboo, Arundinaria alpina; at lower altitudes often at forest margins. This is a very clear example of an afro-montane endemic.
Native range
Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
Tree management

In Tanzania, trees are planted or wildings are allowed to grow, interspersed throughout a field at a density of about 10 trees/ha. To reduce light competition with crop and foster marketable bole development, the trees are pruned once each year in November, about two months before planting crops at the onset of the rainy season. Typically, annual prunings of mature trees remove 40-50% of the canopy height. Pollarding is also a suitable silvicultural practice.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; hermetic air-dry storage at cool temperatures is recommended. On average, there are 400 000-500 000 seeds/kg.

Pretreatment is not necessary and seeds germinate within 10-20 days of planting with a germination rate of 40-60%. Trees can also be regenerated from seedlings or wildings.
Erosion control: Trees are employed in soil-conservation activities.
H. abyssinica is a good source of firewood and charcoal.
Timber: Wood is dark red, medium soft but not durable; it is used for furniture, poles, flooring, carving and cabinet making.
Shade or shelter: The fire-resistant species can be used as a firebreak.
Medicine: The roots are cooked with meat and the soup drunk for general illness and malaria, while the dried and pounded female inflorescence is used as an anthelmintic (especially for tapeworm). Bark may be pounded, added to cold water and the liquid drunk as a remedy for diarrhoea and stomach-ache. Generally, this is a strong medicine that must not be taken in large quantities; it is sometimes taken as an abortifacient.
Ornamental: The attractive tree is suitable for planting in amenity areas.
Soil improver: Hagenia constantly sheds leaves, providing mulch and green manure.
Intercropping: In an experiment in Makete District Tanzania, grain yield of wheat was measured on eight different farms for a two-year period. The threshed wheat yield under a pruned H. abyssinica canopy averaged 810 kg/ha compared to 600kg/ha on parts of the field located at least 30 m from a tree."

Hardwickia binata is a moderate-sized to large tree, up to 24-30 m tall, girth 1.8-3 m with a clean cylindrical bole up to 12-15 m; graceful, drooping slender branches; crown conical in early life, becoming broader later. Bark of saplings almost silvery white and smooth, gradually changing as the tree gets older to dark grey and rough with irregular vertical cracks, 1.2-2.5 cm thick, exfoliating in narrow flakes. In isolated situations, or on poor soils, the tree tends to branch low down and produce a short bole, but when grown in a fairly crowded crop on favourable soil it produces a long, straight, cylindrical bole with an elevated crown.

Leaves small, 2-6 cm long by 2-3 cm wide, alternate, pinnate, almost kidney shaped and greyish-green.

Flowers small, pale yellowish-green in axillary and terminal lax panicled racemes.

The pod flat and samaroid, 5-7.6 x 1-1.5 cm, oblong lanceolate, coriaceous, narrowed at both ends, with parallel longitudinal veins, containing 1 seed near the apex. The seed is exalbuminous, flat, averaging 0.8 x 0.3 in, in sub-reniform, pointed at one end and rounded at the other, with a fairly hard testa.
Ecology

Characteristically found in teak forests, dry savannah and degraded dry deciduous forests. The tree is distributed in isolated patches, varying in extent in the drier parts of the Indian Peninsula. Overlying soil does not have to be deep since the taproot has a capacity for growing through fissures in solid rock. H. binata thrives in a dry climate characterized by a long drought, scanty to moderate rainfall, and intense heat during the hot season. In the cold season, frosts, generally mild, occur only in certain portions of its area of distribution, particularly in low-lying areas. In its natural range, the seedlings are sensitive to drought, while frosts are not severe enough to do any harm. From the 2nd year onwards, they are immune to injury from frost. Young shoots are sensitive to fire, but recovery is good.
Native range
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

The tree thrives in a dry climate and is capable of establishing itself and growing on dry shallow soil and rocky ground where most other species would succumb. This is due partly to the early development of the taproot and the ability to penetrate hard soil and fissures in solid rock (the stem usually dying back annually during development of the taproot) and partly to its ability to withstand mutilation. Young trees can withstand some shade and may even require artificial shading. Later they are moderately light demanding. In heavily grazed areas the plant assumes a characteristic bushy form.

The tree pollards well even up to a comparatively advanced age, and old pollards when repollarded almost invariably produce abundant new shoots. However, the tree coppices poorly. Old trees, which send out vigorous pollard shoots if cut 1 or 2 m above the ground, produce no coppice shoots if cut flush with the ground; old pollards when felled at ground level never coppice.
Seed may sometimes retain viability for 1 or even 2 years.

H. binata has been propagated artificially both in and out of its natural habitat, partly by direct sowing and partly by transplanting seedlings, though it is generally agreed that the former is the more successful method.

Fresh mature seed has a high fertility rate and germinates readily with moderate moisture. Germination is epigeous. Growth and survival of seedlings are improved by mulching and shade.
Fodder: Leaves contain about 9% crude protein, but the amount varies with the age of the leaves.
H. binata provides excellent firewood and good charcoal.
Fibre: The bark yields a strong fibre largely employed for making ropes.
Timber: The wood is perhaps the hardest and heaviest in India. The sapwood is small and white, the heartwood dark reddish-brown streaked with purple; used for beams and mine props, bridge and house construction, agricultural implements, carts and wheel work. It is close grained, difficult to season but fairly durable.
Nitrogen fixing: A nodulating species, but there is considerable doubt about whether it is nitrogen fixing or not.
Soil improver: Branches are much lopped for manure; leaves can be used as mulch.
Intercropping: H. binata has a deep-rooting habit, hence competes minimally with arable crops."
Harungana madagascariensis,"Local names:
 Creole (blod tri), English (orange-milk tree,blood tree), Hausa (alillibar), Igbo (ururtu), Luganda (mulirira,mulilira), Swahili (ngoningoni,mgondogondo,mdamu mdamu,mbura,kumamaji), Yoruba (elepo)
Harungana madagascariensis is a small to medium sized bushy tree 4-7 m in height, sometimes reaching 10-25 m; it is much branched with a cylindrical trunk. Crown is golden-green, deep and spreading with fine almost whorled branches. Bole is often rather angular and forked. Bark greyish or red-brown rather rough and scaly, frequently vertically fissured, with very small vertically arranged scales which flake off easily; slash bright orange, thin, rather wet and turgid, but will peel off in long strips, and when cut, brilliant, almost florescent orange latex flows abundantly and by it, the tree can be recognized immediately. This orange paint-like sap exudes if leaves are snapped off or if branches are broken. Most parts of the tree are covered with fine stellate hairs. 

Leaves opposite, simple, ovate or ovate elliptic, 6-20 x 3-10 cm, glossy, dark green above with prominent veining, the under surface with dense rusty hairs which may be partially lost by maturity but usually persist, and rather numerous lateral nerves, which are prominent beneath; young leaves at the ends of branches are distinctive and remain tightly pressed together until quite large, the brown lower surfaces quite characteristic; apex tapering; base broadly tapering to rounded; margin entire; petiole 1.5-3 cm long.

Flowers whitish or cream, about 5 mm in diameter, sweetly almond scented, in dense many-flowered flat terminal heads (corymbose panicles), 8-20 cm in diameter, the stalks and calyx covered with short rusty hairs, bisexual; 5-merous; sepals glandular; petals with hairs on the inside and black gland dots; stamens in 5 clusters, each cluster made up of a few stamens joined for most of their length, with a sterile cluster, or a facsiclode between each fertile cluster; ovary 5-chambered.

Fruits berry-like (drupe), 2-4 mm in diameter, greenish-orange becoming red when mature, in heavy, massed, terminal heads up to 25-30 cm in diameter, rather dry, with a crustaceous pericarp enclosing the 5 pyrenes, 2-4 seeded.
Ecology

H. madagascariensis occurs at medium to low altitudes in evergreen forest, at forest margins and along river and stream banks. It is a common and widely distributed tree from the Sudan to South Africa, often a pioneer when a forest has been cleared. The species is widespread in tropical Africa, and is found in clearings in forest regions and fringing forest in savanna regions. It is found all over Sierra Leone in young farm bush, usually associated with Trema musanga and Nauclea latifolia. In Uganda, it is found in forest edges and in secondary scrub, and is usually associated with Maesopsis eminii and Trema orientalis. The trees have a general brownish-yellow appearance in the field

Artificial propagation is carried out using seedlings and pre-sowing treatment is not necessary. Wildings can also be used, or seeds can be sown directly at the planting site. Seeds germinate soon after sowing, and germination is excellent resulting in a pure stand if sown in a prepared area, such as pots.
H. madagascariensis is a source of firewood and is used in the production of charcoal.
Timber:  The wood is pink, orange-red to yellow and can have most attractive colouring in larger specimens. The tree is not used commercially because it seldom grows to a merchantable size, though the rather light wood is used to make poles for building houses.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Sap extracted from the bark of orange-milk tree is used to dye palm leaves for making mats and other craft items.
Medicine:  Sap is used in the treatment of scabies and as an anthelmintic (tapeworms), while leaves are used as a remedy for hemorrhages, diarrhoea, gonorrhoea, sore throats, headaches and fevers. Resin from the flower stalks is believed to ease colic and to check infection after childbirth, while a decoction of the bark is drunk as a remedy for malaria or jaundice. Roots are used to hasten breast development in young women while roots and bark are boiled in water, and the infusion drunk twice a day, to interrupt the menses. Young leaves are sometimes used a medicine for asthma and fruits are occasionally used in cases of abortion in the belief that the red juice averts bleeding."
Ilex mitis,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (without,waterhout,waterboom), English (watertree,Cape holly,African holly), Xhosa (umDuma), Zulu (iPhuphuma)
An evergreen tree between 20 – 25 m tall, with a straight, rounded canopy.  It is variable in size depending on where it is growing. In the forests of Knysna in South Africa it easily reaches a height of 18 m and may have a trunk diameter of 0.6 m.  Stems are normally round.  Bark on the young tree is a pale grey-brown with patches of white, smooth with fine, traverse ridges and yellow-brown corky specks.  As the tree becomes older it becomes evenly whitish grey with dark and rough spots.

Young twigs are reddish purple in colour.  The lance-shaped, simple, alternate leaves are shiny dark green and are carried on plum-coloured stalks.  They are between 70 – 100 x 19 – 25 mm, with pointed, sometimes curled tips and wavy, sometimes slightly toothed margins.  The plum-coloured leaf stalks help to identify the tree.  The midrib is sharply impressed above and prominent below.

Flowers dioecious, small, white and sweet scented and in bunches between the leaf axils. The forest floor below the trees become carpeted with tiny, white flower petals that are shed as the fruit begins to develop.

Fruits bright red, and densely packed along the stems, provide bright splashes of colour, attracting many kinds of birds. There are several small, round seeds each with a sharp point in each fruit. Fruiting trees are conspicuous when viewed from above.
Ecology

It is very widely distributed in Africa, from sea level to high mountains, growing on the banks of rivers and streams, often found overhanging streams along which it grows and in moist spots in woods and montane forests.  In Uganda it is common in the impenetrable Bwindi forest and on Mt. Elgon.  In Kenya it occurs on the south-west and north-east slopes of Mt. Kenya and in the north-eastern Aberdares in the canopy 9 – 21 m, in valleys and ravines associated with Albizia gummifera, A. schimperania, Fagara spp. Hagenia spp., Macaranga kilimandscharica, M. conglomerata, Ocotea usambarensis, Prunus Africana and Rapanea rhododendroides.
Native range
Kenya, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda
Tree management

Ilex mitis is a fairly fast growing tree, 0.8 m a year being possible, transplants well but needs protection whilst young.  The tree responds well to pruning, lopping and pollarding.  Ilex mitis grows best when planted alongside a running stream and is one of the few indigenous evergreen trees in South Africa which can cope with frost, making it especially suitable for cold areas.  To be sure of fruit, one should plant a small grove of these trees and remove extra males later.
Fresh seed germinates easily. Seeds collected from the tree, or those fallen below the tree should be allowed to dry gradually. Trees can be very tall, making collection off the tree very difficult. They should then be sown into a tray containing a 1:1 mixture of river sand and compost. Seedling mix obtained from nursery centres is also suitable. Seed should be covered lightly with the soil mix and then kept damp. Although germination can be erratic, seeds usually begin to germinate 8-20 days after sowing. The seedlings need to be transplanted into a mix of sand and compost in bags at the two-leaf stage.

Propagation is mainly via seeds, wildings can also be collected from the forest.
Apiculture:  the honey from this tree is very white and is highly prized in Kenya.
Fuelwood:  Ilex mitis is also used as fuelwood.
Timber:  The wood is close-grained, medium-hard and medium-heavy and whitish to grey-green in colour that is easily worked and can be attractively marked. Though used as timber, normally the trunk is too short to obtain long boards.  The wood was once used in the construction of wagons for buckboards and occasionally for spokes. It was also in demand for the heels of ladies shoes and is still used for implement handles and furniture.
Medicine:  small pieces of bark are chewed as purgative and also used in the preparation of enema for treating colic in children.  Sotho witchdoctors in southern Africa include the plant in their divine dice to protect sick people from being bewitched.
Ornamental:  The bright red fruits and glossy leaves make Ilex mitis a great candidate for ornamental purposes.
Other services:  there is a belief that the presence of this tree is an indication of underground water near the surface.  The brilliant red fruits in autumn attract birds who also aid in seed dispersal. In the Knysna (South Africa) forests elephants show"
Illicium verum,"Local names:
 Danish (Stjerneanis,Stjerne Anis), Dutch (Steranijs,Adas china), English (star anise), French (badiane,anis de la Chine), German (Sternanis,Badian), Hindi (Anasphal,Badayan), Indonesian (bunga lawang,Adas cina,Pe ka), Italian (Anice stellato), Khmer (Phk
Illicium verum is an evergreen medium sized tree, 8-15 (-20) m tall and up to 30 cm dbh with a straight rounded trunk and green, glabrous branchlets. The bark is white to bright grey.

Leaves 6-12 cm long, alternate, simple, leathery, often clustered 3-4 together at the end of branches

Flowers large, bisexual, 1-1.5 cm in diameter, white-pink to red or greenish-yellow, axillary and solitary.

Fruit capsule-like, aggregate fruit made up of 6-8 or rarely up to 12-13 boat-shaped, rather woody follicles with a straight beak. Each follicle contains one seed

Seed shiny brown or reddish with high oil content and anise-like smell.


The genus name is derived from Latin ‘illicere’ (allure), probably because of the sweet and attractive fragrance.
Ecology

I. verum is a light demander but tolerates shade when young. It should not be planted on soils generated from limestone; deep ravine where light is insufficient, moisture is too much; area in which dominant species are Imperata cylindrica and bushes such as Artemisia annua, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Melastioma candidum indicators of much deteriorated soil.
Native range
China, Vietnam
Tree management

Pure plantation of I. verum can be established by planting seedling with a spacing of 4 x 5 m. This gives a density of 420 stems/ha as a final crop. When planted mixed with other species such as Camellia oleifera, Canarium album, Mandarin and Tea, rows spacing of 3-4m is used, and the remaining density of about 150-200 trees/ha is expected. This mixed planting is commonly used in Vietnam, creating sustainable forest environment in such areas.
Fruits are harvested directly from the tree when they are still green, dried first in the shade and then in the sun. The fruits are collected in October when they turn brown but before they open. After a short sun drying, the seeds are extracted manually. Dead or damaged seed can be separated from fresh seed by floatation. A mature tree may yield 8-12 kg fresh fruits per season. 4-5 kg fresh fruits give approximately 1 kg dry fruits.

Studies from Vietnam indicate that the seeds do not tolerate desiccation and that best viability is achieved when the seeds are stored at about 40% moisture content. When dried below 30% mc, the seeds begin to lose viability. Cold storage at 5 or 10° C is significantly better than at room temperature. In another study, fresh seeds mixed with moist sand and stored at 10° C for 3 months retained 53% germination. There are 8000 - 11000 seeds per kg.

I. verum is usually propagated by seeds, cuttings and grafting. The newly harvested seeds have a germination rate of 40%, compared to 80% exhibited after one month’s storage in moist sand, probably due to after-ripening or some sort of dormancy. Germination normally begins after 27 days, continuing for over 2 months. Seeds collected during the September - October harvest season are preferred for propagation. The seedlings are planted out into the field when they attain a height of about 30 cm.
It is widely planted in areas for rehabilitation
Erosion control: I. verum is a perennial tree species with good effects on soil and water conservation. 
 Fruits and seeds are valued as a spice used in cooking.
Timber: The fragrant wood is used for construction and furniture.
Medicine: The oil of star anise is used worldwide in medicine. It is used as stimulant, eupeptic, carminative, mildly expectorant and diuretic. It is found to be useful in flatulence, spasmodic pains and dysentery. It relieves colic and is a common ingredient of cough lozenges and cattle sprays. The oil is employed as an applicant in rheumatism, as an antiseptic, useful against fevers, scabies, body lice, bedbugs, and highly useful in constipation and insomnia.
Intercropping: It can be planted mixed with some other tree species such as Canarium album, Mandarin and Tea
Essential oil: Star anise is mainly grown for the essential oil that is extracted from fruits, seeds and leaves. 10 kg of dry fruits yield 1 kg oil. The dried fruits may contain 5 to 8% of essential oil, which dominated by anethole (85 to 90%). "
Indigofera arrecta,"Local names:
 Arabic (nilaj,Nil), English (Natal indigo,Java indigo,Bengal-indigo,Bengal indigo), French (Indigotier chessé,indigotier), Indonesian (tom katemas), Swahili (Mnili)
Indigofera arrecta is an erect, woody, large shrub up to 3 m tall.

Leaves arranged spirally, imparipinnate; stipules subulate-setaceous, 2–9 mm long; petiole up to 1.5 cm long, pulvinate; rachis up to 6 cm long, strigulose; stipels subulate, up to 1 mm long; petiolules 1 mm long; leaflets 7–21, narrowly elliptical-oblong, up to 2 cm × 0.7 cm, usually glabrous above and strigulose below.

Inflorescence a many-flowered axillary raceme up to 5 cm long but usually much shorter, often sessile; bracts lanceolate, to 1 mm long, caducous. Flowers bisexual, zygomorphic; pedicel to 1 mm long, strongly reflexed in fruit; calyx to 1.5 mm long, the tube about as long as the 5 triangular lobes, brownish strigulose; corolla to 5 mm long, pinkish or reddish, brown strigulose outside, standard longer than wide, narrowed gradually to the base, keel laterally spurred, wings with very short claws; stamens 10, 3–4 mm long, upper filament free, the others united, anthers dorsifixed, apiculate; ovary superior, 1-celled, with long style.

Fruit a linear pod 12–25 mm long and to 2 mm wide, straight, slightly tetragonal, brown when ripe, 4–8-seeded.

Seeds shortly oblong, rhombic in cross-section. 

I. arrecta, I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria are closely related and intermediate specimens (possibly of hybrid origin) have been found.
Ecology

Natal indigo occurs in open deciduous forest, upland evergreen bushland, often in forest margins, and secondary regrowth. Plants prefer a hot, moist climate with a rainfall of no less than 1750 mm/year.  The crop withstands waterlogging for up to 2 months.
Native range
Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia
Tree management

When used as a cover crop, I. arrecta can only be grown in gardens with little or no shade. Weeding and earthing up is done about 1 month after planting and again 1 month later.  Cover crops are slashed at regular intervals. Branches are harvested, usually early in the morning, when the plants are 4-5 months old and the crop has made a closed stand.  This is usually the flowering stage.  About 3-4 months later the plants can be cut again; a crop can be harvested three times a year.  The total life span for dye crops is 2-3 years for cover crops. The yield of this species is higher than from any other species of Indigofera.  Annual yields of 22-100 t green matter per ha have been reported in India; the recorded output of indigo cake is 137-325 kg/ha per year. The plant is deep-rooting and withstands drought well.
 
Natal indigo occurs in open deciduous forest, upland evergreen bushland, often in forest margins, and secondary regrowth. Plants prefer a hot, moist climate with a rainfall of no less than 1750 mm/year.  The crop withstands waterlogging for up to 2 months.
I. arrecta is propagated by seed or cuttings.  Seeds possess a hard seed coat and must be scarified.  Sowing is done either on seedbeds or directly into the field, 3-4 seeds per hole, 60 cm apart within rows and 45-60 cm between rows.  When seedbeds are used, seedlings are transplanted at 4-6 weeks.

Cuttings are made by dividing well-developed branches into pieces 30 cm long, which are kept for 2-3 days in a cool place before planting.  Cuttings, 2-3 per hole, start rooting by the second week.
Browsed toward the end of the dry season, when the young subsidiary shoots are readily eaten.
Tannin or dyestuff: I. arrecta is the chief source of blue dye. The harvested branches are placed in a tank containing water to which some lime has been added and weighted down with planks.  After some hours of fermentation, during which enzymic hydrolysis leads to the formation of indoxyl, the liquid is drained off and stirred continuously for several hours to stimulate oxidation of the indoxyl.  Afterwards the solution is left to rest and the insoluble indigo settles to the bottom as a blueish sludge.  The water is drained and after the indigo has dried, it is cut into cubes or made into balls.  
Medicine: The leaves are used in traditional medicines for epilepsy and nervous disorders and to heal sores and ulcers.
Soil improver: It is also used as a cover crop and a green manure."
Inga edulis,"Local names:
 English (ice-cream bean tree), French (pois sucre,ingá), Portuguese (inga-de-metro,inga-cipo,cajasciro), Spanish (rabo de mico,inga,huaba,guano,guamo bejuco,guabo,guaba), Trade name (guaba)
Inga edulis mature trees reach 30 m high and 60 cm diameter at breast height, usually branching from below 3 m. The branches form a broad, flat, moderately dense canopy. The bark is pale grey and smooth with pale elongated lenticels. The young twigs are angular in cross-section and covered with fine short hairs.

Leaves, once-pinnate, up to 24 cm long, with 4-6 pairs of opposite leaflets. The terminal pair of leaflets is larger than the basal pair and can be up to 18 cm long and 11 cm wide. Between each leaflet there is a nectary gland on the leaf rachis. The seedlings have a characteristic greyish sheen on the upper leaf surface.

Inflorescence in dense axillary spikes of flowers, each consisting of a calyx tube with 5 lobes, a corolla tube with 5 lobes, and a large number of white stamens up to 4.5 cm long, united in a tube in the lower half.

Fruits ribbed, cylindrical pods, straight or often spirally twisted, up to 1 m long. They contain fleshy green seeds in a sweet, white, cottony pulp. They are produced during the wet season, and monkeys and birds eat the sweet pulp and scatter the soft seeds.

The name ‘inga’ is derived from its name with the Tupi Indians of South America. The specific name, ‘edulis’, means edible.
Ecology

I. edulis grows rapidly on the poorest Exisols and can also be found on floodplains that are waterlogged for 2-3 months each year. Although generally associated with warm, lowland, wet tropics, it is also remarkably resistant to drought and cold, occurring in regions with a 6-month drought. It is a light-demanding gap species of lowland rain forest, where it becomes a large tree, and it is also found in riparian situations.
Native range
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
Tree management

An area 1 m in diameter should be kept clear around the tree for the 1st 6 months of growth. I. edulis grows back well after pruning, but not if cut below 0.75 m. There is a better response if pruning height is varied and a few branches are left uncut. The cut should be made carefully, at least 3 cm above a node from which the shoots can grow again.
The seeds are recalcitrant and sometimes begin to germinate in the pod, often within a few days of reaching the ground, where they need moisture to survive. The seeds can be stored for only 2 weeks. Best results have been achieved by removing the pulp and storing the seed in impermeable bags.

It is a light-demanding gap species of lowland rain forest, where it becomes a large tree, and it is also found in riparian situations.
Farmers sometimes sow I. edulis seeds directly in the field. This must be during a season of regular rainfall to avoid seed desiccation. Direct sowing has not proven to be a reliable method for establishing the species. Normally, only 1 seed should be sown in a plastic bag, no more than 2 cm below the soil surface. Semi-shade should be provided, if possible. The seeds germinate readily (95-100% germination rate) in 2-3 days. Seedlings are normally kept in the nursery for 2-3 months. They should be watered regularly, and the shade should be removed 1 month before transplanting. Bare-root seedlings can successfully be transplanted directly from the nursery.
In trial experiments on cultivated slopes, I. edulis mulch reduced soil erosion to levels almost equal to those in secondary forests.
 The large fruit is popular in all the regions where I. edulis is grown. In Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica and Ecuador, they are sold in the marketplace.
Fodder: Pigs eat seeds when hungry, and cattle will even eat whole pods and leaves.
The ease with which the seed germinates, its quick growth, rusticity and high coppicing ability make this species useful for the smallholder’s woodlot and it is also a useful bush-fallow species. The branches are a popular source of firewood, with a high calorific value and little smoke, although the tree is not cultivated specifically for fuel.
Shade or shelter: I. edulis has been used as a shade tree for perennial crops, mainly coffee and cacao since the beginning of the 19th century. The open crown and rapid growth provide excellent shade, and trees are widely used for this purpose around dwel
Nitrogen fixing: Due to its nitrogen-fixation ability, I. edulis has been employed in improved fallows.
Soil improver: The litter is high in nitrogen, lignins and polyphenols. It is slow to decompose, but provides a long-term build up of organic nitrogen and effective weed control. Weed biomass decreased considerably in all agroforestry trials with I. edulis, much more than with other leguminous species. Existing trials are too new to ascertain whether the species can maintain or improve soil fertility on acid sites in the long term, but results so far are promising."
Inga vera,"Local names:
 Creole (sikren,pwa dou), English (river-koko,pan chock), French (sucrin,sucrier,pois sucrin,pois doux à paille,pois doux), Spanish (inga,guavo,guamá jina,guamà,guaba nativa,guaba)
Inga vera is a medium-sized evergreen tree 12-18 m tall, with trunk 30-60 cm in diameter (sometimes to 20 m tall and 1 m in diameter) with a widely spreading crown of long branches and thin foliage. Bark grey-brown, fairly smooth but becoming finely fissured; inner bark pinkish to brown. Twigs brown, often zigzag, with dense brown hairs when young. 

Leaves alternate in 2 rows, pinnately compound, 18-30 cm long; axis 6-18 cm long, brown, hairy, with a green wing 6-10 mm broad. Leaflets 3-7 pairs, slightly drooping, stalkless, with a tiny round gland between each pair, elliptical to oblong, 5-15 x 2.5-7 cm, larger from base towards the end, long pointed at tip and short pointed at base, not toothed on edges, thin and slightly convex, slightly hairy, especially on veins, upper surface green, underneath pale green. 

Flower clusters 1-4 on base of leaf or at end of twig, consisting of several stalkless flowers crowded near end of hairy stalk, only 1 or 2 open daily. Each flower 6-7.5 x 7.5-9 cm, with many threadlike white stamens. Flower fully expanded at dawn but soon wilts in daylight. Calyx tubular, cylindrical, 5-toothed, corolla a narrow cylindrical tube about 15 mm long with 5 short spreading lobes, greenish-yellow with dense brown hairs; numerous stamens united into a tube inside the corolla; pistil with long narrow ovary and very slender style. 

Pods nearly cylindrical, narrow, 10-20 cm long, 1-2 cm wide, 4-ribbed, with 2 long grooves, slightly curved, densely hairy, brown, with calyx at base, not splitting open. Seeds few, beanlike, black, in white, sweetish, edible pulp.

The name ‘inga’ is derived from its name with the Tupi Indians of South America. The specific Latin name, ‘vera’, means ‘true’ or ‘genuine’. Based on material collected in Jamaica, this species was the first to be named and the one upon which the classification of the rest of this large genus was based.
Ecology

I. vera is suitable to the climate of the humid tropics with a high rainfall.
Native range
Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico
Tree management

A fast-growing species, the trunk often grows more than 2.5 cm in diameter in a year. Trees coppice well. On lower slopes and along streams, this tree grows very rapidly, producing sufficient shade for coffee within 3 years.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant. Lowest safe mc of cotyledons is 40%; lowest safe embryo mc is 52%; seeds cannot survive desiccation below 25% mc and embryos below 40% mc.
I. vera is suitable to the climate of the humid tropics with a high rainfall.
Shortly after collecting, pods are macerated and the seeds separated from the fermentable pulp using copious amounts of water. Seeds germinate rapidly, sometimes even viviparously, but are short lived, especially when dried.
 Seeds of this and many other species of Inga are enclosed in sugary edible pulp.
Apiculture: With flowers rich in nectar and attractive to bees, the tree is a good honey source.
The moderately heavy wood makes excellent fuel and is used for charcoal throughout the West Indies.
Timber: Sapwood whitish and heartwood pale brown to golden brown with longitudinal streaks or patches of darker brown, often shaded with green or yellow. Wood moderately hard, slightly heavy (specific gravity 0.57-0.59), strong and tough. The timber is suitable for utility furniture, boxes, crates, light construction, posts and general carpentry. 
Shade or shelter: Frequently used as a shade tree for coffee and cacao and as an avenue shade tree.
Medicine: Macerated bark is taken orally for anaemia, a root decoction for gallstones, and fruit pulp for constipation. Reported to be astringent and diuretic.
Nitrogen fixing: Widely grown with other species for its good nitrogen-fixing ability.
Intercropping: This leguminous shade tree is often planted with coffee."
Intsia bijuga,"Local names:
 English (Moluccan ironwood,Borneo teak), Fijian (vesi), Filipino (ipil laut,ipil), Indonesian (merbau asam), Malay (merbau ipil), Thai (pradu thale,maka-mong,lumpho-thale,lumpaw), Trade name (merbau), Vietnamese (go-nuoc,g[ox])
Intsia bijuga is a common medium-sized, unarmed tree of up to 35-(50) m in height. Mature trees have steep rounded buttresses which when fully developed can exceed 4 m. It has been suggested that these buttresses grant the Moluccan ironwood competitive advantage by preventing establishment of competing individuals in the space occupied by the buttresses. The bole can be crooked or straight but the crown is usually spreading and branchlets are glabrous.

Leaves paripinnate and semi-deciduous, leaflets 1-6 varying in shape from broadly ovate to obovate, oblong or subfalcate and thinly coriaceous.

Inflorescence 5-18 cm varying from very corymbiformly racemose to racemiform. Flowers white and arranged in dense terminal panicles. Bracts, bracteoles and calyx densely short-hairy to glabrous. Pedicels 1-2.25 cm, calyx-tube 7-15 mm segments 9-19 mm. Petals often red or pink in colour.

Fruit pod oblong or pear shaped, 8-23 cm x 4-8 cm. Pod leathery,woody and tardily dehiscent usually containing 1-9 seeds.

The genus Intsia has 7-9 species of tropical distribution. Intsia is closely related to Afzelia. It is difficult to assign sterile material to either genus. Intsia differs from Afzelia by its three fertile stamens, its flat seeds lacking an aril and its leathery pods. I. bijuga is the most widespread representative of the genus in the Malesian region. I. bijuga seems seriously threatened due to its overexploitation, however, its inclusion in Appendix II of CITES in 1992 was thwarted by Malaysia’s objection.
Ecology

I. bijuga is oftenly found on sand and coral beaches, but also features in periodically inundated localities further inland. It also occurs in dryland mangroves which are the final stage of mangrove forest succession and the transition to inland forests.
Native range
Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

The tree is tolerant to salt spray and soil salinity. However, ipil is susceptible to frost and moderately resistant to drought. Seedlings need high light intensity for optimal growth. Seedlings can be transplanted into the field after 3 months, at a spacing of 3m x 4m or 5m x 5m. The tree is slow growing and may attain maturity at 80 years. A 50-60 year rotation is recommended for natural stands.
Seeds of I. bijuga germinate well in full sunlight. Scarification is necessary because of the hard seed coat, the most effective scarification technique is by the use of a file to scrape off the small protrusion of the seed-coat located opposite the hilum. Immersion in concentrated sulphuric acid serves the same purpose. Treatment of scarified seeds with fungicides e.g. benlate or daconil may prevent fungal destruction. Seeds must be planted vertically with the hilum downward, so that the seed coat is shed as the hypocotyl emerges from the soil.
I. bijuga is oftenly found on sand and coral beaches, but also features in periodically inundated localities further inland. It also occurs in dryland mangroves which are the final stage of mangrove forest succession and the transition to inland forests.
Seed may be sown directly in the field. Propagation of bare root seedlings is popular, although stump cuttings have also been successfully used. Natural regeneration from fallen seed is good well in over logged areas. Vegetative propagation by means of 60 cm cuttings in the Philippines, had high mortality rates (62%).
Poison:  Seed oil of I. bijuga repels the stored products, tenebrionid pest Tribolium castaneum and compare favourably with neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts.
Ipil can be used to reclaim land degraded by gulley erosion.
Erosion control:  Ipil is a suitable tree for soil conservation in eroded gullies and in buffer strips along creeks.
  The seeds can be eaten after careful preparation, soaked in salt water for 3-4 days and then boiled.
Apiculture:  The flowers of the Mollucan ironwood are visited by pollinators for pollen and nectar.
The small branches of felled trees are used as firewood.
Timber:  U’ula timber is highly prized within the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Malaysia and is used for heavy construction for instance bridge making, power pole cross-arms, railway sleepers, boat building, house post beams and furniture. Other items made from the wood are walking sticks, food bowls, canoes and carvings. I. bijuga is used in constructing the main hull, masthead, maststep and steering oar of ocean-going canoes. Desirable properties of the timber are its strength, workability, satisfactory glueing, durability and its moderate resistance to ocean water. The wood does not shrink drastically on seasoning and has a density of 630-1 040 kg/cu m at 15% moisture content. The heartwood is durable (very difficult to treat with preservatives) and shows an average service life of 6-11.5 years in contact with the ground under tropical conditions and 20 years under temperate conditions. In experimental trials with small wood samples, I. bijuga was durable against the dry-wood termite Cryptotermes cynocephalus and the subterranean termite Coptotermes curvignathus.
Shade or shelter:  Ipil has an excellent shade suitable for homes and parks, the tree is wind tolerant thus ideal as a windbreak.
Tannin or dyestuff:  A brown dye is obtained from an oily substance present in the wood and bark.
Medicine:  The bark is used in treating persons suffering from a urinary condition (characterised by very dark urine). U’ula is also used in the treatment of rheumatism, dysentery and diarrhoea. An infusion of ipil bark is given to women after delivery.
Nitrogen fixing:  I. bijuga is confirmed to form nodules in published reports.
U’ula is such a reputed fence post provider that it was recommended in the early 1970’s by the Livestock Department, Solomon Islands for a fencing programme.
Soil improver:  The average total annual litter production in I. bijuga is, 8789.4 kg/ha with a high leaf litter decomposition rate. Initial tannin content of the leaf litter is the major chemical factor inhibiting decomposition. High uptake of Ca from the subsoil and its enrichment in the surface soil resulted in higher soil pH under I. bijuga.
Other services: In former times ipil was considered sacred in Fiji. The bowl for serving the esteemed traditional beverage, yagona, was made from ipil wood. 
Pollution control:  Ipil is used in water purification."
Irvingia gabonensis,"Local names:
 English (wild mango,native mango,duiker nut,bush mango,bread tree,African mango tree), French (manguier sauvage,bobo), Hausa (goron,biri), Igbo (obono), Trade name (dika nut), Yoruba (oro)
Irvingia gabonensis grows to a height of 15-40 m, bole slightly buttressed. It has a dense, compact crown, branchlets ending in a narrow, curved, stipular sheath covering the leaf bud. Bark greyish, smooth or very slightly scaly; slash yellowish-brown to light yellow, brittle.

I. gabonensis occurs in the wild in lowland forest; 2-3 trees occur together and in some areas it is reported to be gregarious. The dika nut tree is a species of dense moist forest.
Can be successfully propagated vegetatively by budding. Large-scale production of trees requires raising them in a nursery.
Wax: Contains waxes useful as an adjunct in making medicinal tablets.
Erosion control: Planted alongside other species to check soil erosion.
 Fruit pulp is palatable and can be used for a fruit drink and for jam production. The kernel can be processed into flour by extraction, drying and grinding. The pounded seed is added to meat and various vegetable dishes as a sauce. Margarine and cooking oil can be obtained from the kernels.
Fodder: Seeds are used as cattle cake in Ghana.
Timber: Wood pale brown, very hard and fine grained, not easy to cut, which limits its usefulness. Its weight precludes it from all but the most rugged construction work, e.g. for railway ties. Useful for making canoes and pestles for yam mortars; also suitable for boards, planking, ship decking and paving blocks.
Tannin or dyestuff: Reported to contain tannin in both bark and roots.
Lipids: Kernels contain oil used for making soaps, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
Medicine: Relieves diarrhoea and dysentery. Used internally as a purgative, for gastrointestinal and liver conditions, for sterility, hernias and urethral discharge, and is considered to be a powerful aphrodisiac."
Irvingia wombolu,"Local names:
 English (bitter bush mango)
Irvingia wombolu is a tree to 25-30 m tall, butressed up to 2 m. The stem is often leaning and glabrous. The first branches are usually at a height of 7-10 m. Foliage regular, not as dense as in the Irvingia gabonensis.

Leaves simple, alternate, entire, obovate, and less leathery, length 10.5-14 cm, width 4-8.5 cm, leaf apex rounded, often with a barely distinct blunt acumen, base obtuse to acute, occasionally very shortly cuneate. Leaf stipules leave an annular scar around the stem when they fall off.

Fruit with green skin which may turn yellow on ripening. Flesh of fruit yellow, soft, juicy and fibrous, extremely bitter and inedible. When the flesh rots away the fruit the shell may have some curly fibres attached to it. The shell wall is less than 7 mm thick and is easy to break open using a wooden club or a stone.

This tree closely resembles Irvingia gabonensis, genetic data indicates significant differences between the two, supporting (Harris 1996) conclusion that the taxa are distinct genetic entities. 

The genus name commemorates E.G. Irving, 1816-1855, a Scottish botanist.
Ecology

The bitter bush mango shows a wider rainfall regime tolerance than the other Irvingia species. It occurs in dry land forest in areas with more than 1 500 mm rainfall across the southern half of the Central African Republic from Cameroon in the west to Sudan in the east. In some localities it is common in swamps and seasonally flooded forest than in adjacent dry land forest.
Native range
Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Uganda
Tree management

The members of the genus Irvingia are fire tender.
Germination is epigeous and phanercotylar, beginning at about 1 month and occuring faster under the mother tree. The seeds of I. wombolu are recalcitrant and should be sown fresh.

  The seeds are collected and their cotyledons grilled or dried in the sun, pounded then used in preparation of a local dish 'gumbo'. The mesocarp is inedible. I. wombolu seeds give a more mucilaginous texture to food, this attribute makes the seeds command a higher market price. Overcooking causes the loss of sliminess. The sauce keeps for several days without refrigeration. The dried kernel can be stored for up to a year, as can the paste if it is thoroughly dried in the sun.
Apiculture:  Insects visit the flowers for pollen.
Shade or shelter:  The bitter bush mango provides adequate shade.
Medicine:  The fresh bark of the tree is considered to be a powerful antibiotic against scabies, a cure for diarrhoea when mixed with palm oil and a toothache remedy.
Intercropping:  I. wombolu has high agroforestry potential. In its native range it is found cultivated with other crops in farm systems."
Ilex mitis,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (without,waterhout,waterboom), English (watertree,Cape holly,African holly), Xhosa (umDuma), Zulu (iPhuphuma)
An evergreen tree between 20 – 25 m tall, with a straight, rounded canopy.  It is variable in size depending on where it is growing. In the forests of Knysna in South Africa it easily reaches a height of 18 m and may have a trunk diameter of 0.6 m.  Stems are normally round.  Bark on the young tree is a pale grey-brown with patches of white, smooth with fine, traverse ridges and yellow-brown corky specks.  As the tree becomes older it becomes evenly whitish grey with dark and rough spots.

Young twigs are reddish purple in colour.  The lance-shaped, simple, alternate leaves are shiny dark green and are carried on plum-coloured stalks.  They are between 70 – 100 x 19 – 25 mm, with pointed, sometimes curled tips and wavy, sometimes slightly toothed margins.  The plum-coloured leaf stalks help to identify the tree.  The midrib is sharply impressed above and prominent below.

Flowers dioecious, small, white and sweet scented and in bunches between the leaf axils. The forest floor below the trees become carpeted with tiny, white flower petals that are shed as the fruit begins to develop.

Fruits bright red, and densely packed along the stems, provide bright splashes of colour, attracting many kinds of birds. There are several small, round seeds each with a sharp point in each fruit. Fruiting trees are conspicuous when viewed from above.
Ecology

It is very widely distributed in Africa, from sea level to high mountains, growing on the banks of rivers and streams, often found overhanging streams along which it grows and in moist spots in woods and montane forests.  In Uganda it is common in the impenetrable Bwindi forest and on Mt. Elgon.  In Kenya it occurs on the south-west and north-east slopes of Mt. Kenya and in the north-eastern Aberdares in the canopy 9 – 21 m, in valleys and ravines associated with Albizia gummifera, A. schimperania, Fagara spp. Hagenia spp., Macaranga kilimandscharica, M. conglomerata, Ocotea usambarensis, Prunus Africana and Rapanea rhododendroides.
Native range
Kenya, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda
Tree management

Ilex mitis is a fairly fast growing tree, 0.8 m a year being possible, transplants well but needs protection whilst young.  The tree responds well to pruning, lopping and pollarding.  Ilex mitis grows best when planted alongside a running stream and is one of the few indigenous evergreen trees in South Africa which can cope with frost, making it especially suitable for cold areas.  To be sure of fruit, one should plant a small grove of these trees and remove extra males later.
Fresh seed germinates easily. Seeds collected from the tree, or those fallen below the tree should be allowed to dry gradually. Trees can be very tall, making collection off the tree very difficult. They should then be sown into a tray containing a 1:1 mixture of river sand and compost. Seedling mix obtained from nursery centres is also suitable. Seed should be covered lightly with the soil mix and then kept damp. Although germination can be erratic, seeds usually begin to germinate 8-20 days after sowing. The seedlings need to be transplanted into a mix of sand and compost in bags at the two-leaf stage.

Propagation is mainly via seeds, wildings can also be collected from the forest.
Apiculture:  the honey from this tree is very white and is highly prized in Kenya.
Fuelwood:  Ilex mitis is also used as fuelwood.
Timber:  The wood is close-grained, medium-hard and medium-heavy and whitish to grey-green in colour that is easily worked and can be attractively marked. Though used as timber, normally the trunk is too short to obtain long boards.  The wood was once used in the construction of wagons for buckboards and occasionally for spokes. It was also in demand for the heels of ladies shoes and is still used for implement handles and furniture.
Medicine:  small pieces of bark are chewed as purgative and also used in the preparation of enema for treating colic in children.  Sotho witchdoctors in southern Africa include the plant in their divine dice to protect sick people from being bewitched.
Ornamental:  The bright red fruits and glossy leaves make Ilex mitis a great candidate for ornamental purposes.
Other services:  there is a belief that the presence of this tree is an indication of underground water near the surface.  The brilliant red fruits in autumn attract birds who also aid in seed dispersal. In the Knysna (South Africa) forests elephants show"
Illicium verum,"Local names:
 Danish (Stjerneanis,Stjerne Anis), Dutch (Steranijs,Adas china), English (star anise), French (badiane,anis de la Chine), German (Sternanis,Badian), Hindi (Anasphal,Badayan), Indonesian (bunga lawang,Adas cina,Pe ka), Italian (Anice stellato), Khmer (Phk
Illicium verum is an evergreen medium sized tree, 8-15 (-20) m tall and up to 30 cm dbh with a straight rounded trunk and green, glabrous branchlets. The bark is white to bright grey.

Leaves 6-12 cm long, alternate, simple, leathery, often clustered 3-4 together at the end of branches

Flowers large, bisexual, 1-1.5 cm in diameter, white-pink to red or greenish-yellow, axillary and solitary.

Fruit capsule-like, aggregate fruit made up of 6-8 or rarely up to 12-13 boat-shaped, rather woody follicles with a straight beak. Each follicle contains one seed

Seed shiny brown or reddish with high oil content and anise-like smell.


The genus name is derived from Latin ‘illicere’ (allure), probably because of the sweet and attractive fragrance.
Ecology

I. verum is a light demander but tolerates shade when young. It should not be planted on soils generated from limestone; deep ravine where light is insufficient, moisture is too much; area in which dominant species are Imperata cylindrica and bushes such as Artemisia annua, Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Melastioma candidum indicators of much deteriorated soil.
Native range
China, Vietnam
Tree management

Pure plantation of I. verum can be established by planting seedling with a spacing of 4 x 5 m. This gives a density of 420 stems/ha as a final crop. When planted mixed with other species such as Camellia oleifera, Canarium album, Mandarin and Tea, rows spacing of 3-4m is used, and the remaining density of about 150-200 trees/ha is expected. This mixed planting is commonly used in Vietnam, creating sustainable forest environment in such areas.
Fruits are harvested directly from the tree when they are still green, dried first in the shade and then in the sun. The fruits are collected in October when they turn brown but before they open. After a short sun drying, the seeds are extracted manually. Dead or damaged seed can be separated from fresh seed by floatation. A mature tree may yield 8-12 kg fresh fruits per season. 4-5 kg fresh fruits give approximately 1 kg dry fruits.

Studies from Vietnam indicate that the seeds do not tolerate desiccation and that best viability is achieved when the seeds are stored at about 40% moisture content. When dried below 30% mc, the seeds begin to lose viability. Cold storage at 5 or 10° C is significantly better than at room temperature. In another study, fresh seeds mixed with moist sand and stored at 10° C for 3 months retained 53% germination. There are 8000 - 11000 seeds per kg.

I. verum is usually propagated by seeds, cuttings and grafting. The newly harvested seeds have a germination rate of 40%, compared to 80% exhibited after one month’s storage in moist sand, probably due to after-ripening or some sort of dormancy. Germination normally begins after 27 days, continuing for over 2 months. Seeds collected during the September - October harvest season are preferred for propagation. The seedlings are planted out into the field when they attain a height of about 30 cm.
It is widely planted in areas for rehabilitation
Erosion control: I. verum is a perennial tree species with good effects on soil and water conservation. 
 Fruits and seeds are valued as a spice used in cooking.
Timber: The fragrant wood is used for construction and furniture.
Medicine: The oil of star anise is used worldwide in medicine. It is used as stimulant, eupeptic, carminative, mildly expectorant and diuretic. It is found to be useful in flatulence, spasmodic pains and dysentery. It relieves colic and is a common ingredient of cough lozenges and cattle sprays. The oil is employed as an applicant in rheumatism, as an antiseptic, useful against fevers, scabies, body lice, bedbugs, and highly useful in constipation and insomnia.
Intercropping: It can be planted mixed with some other tree species such as Canarium album, Mandarin and Tea
Essential oil: Star anise is mainly grown for the essential oil that is extracted from fruits, seeds and leaves. 10 kg of dry fruits yield 1 kg oil. The dried fruits may contain 5 to 8% of essential oil, which dominated by anethole (85 to 90%). "
Indigofera arrecta,"Local names:
 Arabic (nilaj,Nil), English (Natal indigo,Java indigo,Bengal-indigo,Bengal indigo), French (Indigotier chessé,indigotier), Indonesian (tom katemas), Swahili (Mnili)
Indigofera arrecta is an erect, woody, large shrub up to 3 m tall.

Leaves arranged spirally, imparipinnate; stipules subulate-setaceous, 2–9 mm long; petiole up to 1.5 cm long, pulvinate; rachis up to 6 cm long, strigulose; stipels subulate, up to 1 mm long; petiolules 1 mm long; leaflets 7–21, narrowly elliptical-oblong, up to 2 cm × 0.7 cm, usually glabrous above and strigulose below.

Inflorescence a many-flowered axillary raceme up to 5 cm long but usually much shorter, often sessile; bracts lanceolate, to 1 mm long, caducous. Flowers bisexual, zygomorphic; pedicel to 1 mm long, strongly reflexed in fruit; calyx to 1.5 mm long, the tube about as long as the 5 triangular lobes, brownish strigulose; corolla to 5 mm long, pinkish or reddish, brown strigulose outside, standard longer than wide, narrowed gradually to the base, keel laterally spurred, wings with very short claws; stamens 10, 3–4 mm long, upper filament free, the others united, anthers dorsifixed, apiculate; ovary superior, 1-celled, with long style.

Fruit a linear pod 12–25 mm long and to 2 mm wide, straight, slightly tetragonal, brown when ripe, 4–8-seeded.

Seeds shortly oblong, rhombic in cross-section. 

I. arrecta, I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria are closely related and intermediate specimens (possibly of hybrid origin) have been found.
Ecology

Natal indigo occurs in open deciduous forest, upland evergreen bushland, often in forest margins, and secondary regrowth. Plants prefer a hot, moist climate with a rainfall of no less than 1750 mm/year.  The crop withstands waterlogging for up to 2 months.
Native range
Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia
Tree management

When used as a cover crop, I. arrecta can only be grown in gardens with little or no shade. Weeding and earthing up is done about 1 month after planting and again 1 month later.  Cover crops are slashed at regular intervals. Branches are harvested, usually early in the morning, when the plants are 4-5 months old and the crop has made a closed stand.  This is usually the flowering stage.  About 3-4 months later the plants can be cut again; a crop can be harvested three times a year.  The total life span for dye crops is 2-3 years for cover crops. The yield of this species is higher than from any other species of Indigofera.  Annual yields of 22-100 t green matter per ha have been reported in India; the recorded output of indigo cake is 137-325 kg/ha per year. The plant is deep-rooting and withstands drought well.

I. arrecta is propagated by seed or cuttings.  Seeds possess a hard seed coat and must be scarified.  Sowing is done either on seedbeds or directly into the field, 3-4 seeds per hole, 60 cm apart within rows and 45-60 cm between rows.  When seedbeds are used, seedlings are transplanted at 4-6 weeks.

Cuttings are made by dividing well-developed branches into pieces 30 cm long, which are kept for 2-3 days in a cool place before planting.  Cuttings, 2-3 per hole, start rooting by the second week.
Browsed toward the end of the dry season, when the young subsidiary shoots are readily eaten.
Tannin or dyestuff: I. arrecta is the chief source of blue dye. The harvested branches are placed in a tank containing water to which some lime has been added and weighted down with planks.  After some hours of fermentation, during which enzymic hydrolysis leads to the formation of indoxyl, the liquid is drained off and stirred continuously for several hours to stimulate oxidation of the indoxyl.  Afterwards the solution is left to rest and the insoluble indigo settles to the bottom as a blueish sludge.  The water is drained and after the indigo has dried, it is cut into cubes or made into balls.  
Medicine: The leaves are used in traditional medicines for epilepsy and nervous disorders and to heal sores and ulcers.
Soil improver: It is also used as a cover crop and a green manure."
Inga edulis,"Local names:
 English (ice-cream bean tree), French (pois sucre,ingá), Portuguese (inga-de-metro,inga-cipo,cajasciro), Spanish (rabo de mico,inga,huaba,guano,guamo bejuco,guabo,guaba), Trade name (guaba)
Inga edulis mature trees reach 30 m high and 60 cm diameter at breast height, usually branching from below 3 m. The branches form a broad, flat, moderately dense canopy. The bark is pale grey and smooth with pale elongated lenticels. The young twigs are angular in cross-section and covered with fine short hairs.

Leaves, once-pinnate, up to 24 cm long, with 4-6 pairs of opposite leaflets. The terminal pair of leaflets is larger than the basal pair and can be up to 18 cm long and 11 cm wide. Between each leaflet there is a nectary gland on the leaf rachis. The seedlings have a characteristic greyish sheen on the upper leaf surface.

Inflorescence in dense axillary spikes of flowers, each consisting of a calyx tube with 5 lobes, a corolla tube with 5 lobes, and a large number of white stamens up to 4.5 cm long, united in a tube in the lower half.

Fruits ribbed, cylindrical pods, straight or often spirally twisted, up to 1 m long. They contain fleshy green seeds in a sweet, white, cottony pulp. They are produced during the wet season, and monkeys and birds eat the sweet pulp and scatter the soft seeds.

The name ‘inga’ is derived from its name with the Tupi Indians of South America. The specific name, ‘edulis’, means edible.
Ecology

I. edulis grows rapidly on the poorest Exisols and can also be found on floodplains that are waterlogged for 2-3 months each year. Although generally associated with warm, lowland, wet tropics, it is also remarkably resistant to drought and cold, occurring in regions with a 6-month drought. It is a light-demanding gap species of lowland rain forest, where it becomes a large tree, and it is also found in riparian situations.
Native range
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
Tree management

An area 1 m in diameter should be kept clear around the tree for the 1st 6 months of growth. I. edulis grows back well after pruning, but not if cut below 0.75 m. There is a better response if pruning height is varied and a few branches are left uncut. The cut should be made carefully, at least 3 cm above a node from which the shoots can grow again.
The seeds are recalcitrant and sometimes begin to germinate in the pod, often within a few days of reaching the ground, where they need moisture to survive. The seeds can be stored for only 2 weeks. Best results have been achieved by removing the pulp and storing the seed in impermeable bags.

It is a light-demanding gap species of lowland rain forest, where it becomes a large tree, and it is also found in riparian situations.
Farmers sometimes sow I. edulis seeds directly in the field. This must be during a season of regular rainfall to avoid seed desiccation. Direct sowing has not proven to be a reliable method for establishing the species. Normally, only 1 seed should be sown in a plastic bag, no more than 2 cm below the soil surface. Semi-shade should be provided, if possible. The seeds germinate readily (95-100% germination rate) in 2-3 days. Seedlings are normally kept in the nursery for 2-3 months. They should be watered regularly, and the shade should be removed 1 month before transplanting. Bare-root seedlings can successfully be transplanted directly from the nursery.
In trial experiments on cultivated slopes, I. edulis mulch reduced soil erosion to levels almost equal to those in secondary forests.
 The large fruit is popular in all the regions where I. edulis is grown. In Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica and Ecuador, they are sold in the marketplace.
Fodder: Pigs eat seeds when hungry, and cattle will even eat whole pods and leaves.
The ease with which the seed germinates, its quick growth, rusticity and high coppicing ability make this species useful for the smallholder’s woodlot and it is also a useful bush-fallow species. The branches are a popular source of firewood, with a high calorific value and little smoke, although the tree is not cultivated specifically for fuel.
Shade or shelter: I. edulis has been used as a shade tree for perennial crops, mainly coffee and cacao since the beginning of the 19th century. The open crown and rapid growth provide excellent shade, and trees are widely used for this purpose around dwel
Nitrogen fixing: Due to its nitrogen-fixation ability, I. edulis has been employed in improved fallows.
Soil improver: The litter is high in nitrogen, lignins and polyphenols. It is slow to decompose, but provides a long-term build up of organic nitrogen and effective weed control. Weed biomass decreased considerably in all agroforestry trials with I. edulis, much more than with other leguminous species. Existing trials are too new to ascertain whether the species can maintain or improve soil fertility on acid sites in the long term, but results so far are promising."
Inga vera,"Local names:
 Creole (sikren,pwa dou), English (river-koko,pan chock), French (sucrin,sucrier,pois sucrin,pois doux à paille,pois doux), Spanish (inga,guavo,guamá jina,guamà,guaba nativa,guaba)
Inga vera is a medium-sized evergreen tree 12-18 m tall, with trunk 30-60 cm in diameter (sometimes to 20 m tall and 1 m in diameter) with a widely spreading crown of long branches and thin foliage. Bark grey-brown, fairly smooth but becoming finely fissured; inner bark pinkish to brown. Twigs brown, often zigzag, with dense brown hairs when young. 

Leaves alternate in 2 rows, pinnately compound, 18-30 cm long; axis 6-18 cm long, brown, hairy, with a green wing 6-10 mm broad. Leaflets 3-7 pairs, slightly drooping, stalkless, with a tiny round gland between each pair, elliptical to oblong, 5-15 x 2.5-7 cm, larger from base towards the end, long pointed at tip and short pointed at base, not toothed on edges, thin and slightly convex, slightly hairy, especially on veins, upper surface green, underneath pale green. 

Flower clusters 1-4 on base of leaf or at end of twig, consisting of several stalkless flowers crowded near end of hairy stalk, only 1 or 2 open daily. Each flower 6-7.5 x 7.5-9 cm, with many threadlike white stamens. Flower fully expanded at dawn but soon wilts in daylight. Calyx tubular, cylindrical, 5-toothed, corolla a narrow cylindrical tube about 15 mm long with 5 short spreading lobes, greenish-yellow with dense brown hairs; numerous stamens united into a tube inside the corolla; pistil with long narrow ovary and very slender style. 

Pods nearly cylindrical, narrow, 10-20 cm long, 1-2 cm wide, 4-ribbed, with 2 long grooves, slightly curved, densely hairy, brown, with calyx at base, not splitting open. Seeds few, beanlike, black, in white, sweetish, edible pulp.

The name ‘inga’ is derived from its name with the Tupi Indians of South America. The specific Latin name, ‘vera’, means ‘true’ or ‘genuine’. Based on material collected in Jamaica, this species was the first to be named and the one upon which the classification of the rest of this large genus was based.
Ecology

I. vera is suitable to the climate of the humid tropics with a high rainfall.
Native range
Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico
Tree management

A fast-growing species, the trunk often grows more than 2.5 cm in diameter in a year. Trees coppice well. On lower slopes and along streams, this tree grows very rapidly, producing sufficient shade for coffee within 3 years.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant. Lowest safe mc of cotyledons is 40%; lowest safe embryo mc is 52%; seeds cannot survive desiccation below 25% mc and embryos below 40% mc.
I. vera is suitable to the climate of the humid tropics with a high rainfall.
Shortly after collecting, pods are macerated and the seeds separated from the fermentable pulp using copious amounts of water. Seeds germinate rapidly, sometimes even viviparously, but are short lived, especially when dried.
 Seeds of this and many other species of Inga are enclosed in sugary edible pulp.
Apiculture: With flowers rich in nectar and attractive to bees, the tree is a good honey source.
The moderately heavy wood makes excellent fuel and is used for charcoal throughout the West Indies.
Timber: Sapwood whitish and heartwood pale brown to golden brown with longitudinal streaks or patches of darker brown, often shaded with green or yellow. Wood moderately hard, slightly heavy (specific gravity 0.57-0.59), strong and tough. The timber is suitable for utility furniture, boxes, crates, light construction, posts and general carpentry. 
Shade or shelter: Frequently used as a shade tree for coffee and cacao and as an avenue shade tree.
Medicine: Macerated bark is taken orally for anaemia, a root decoction for gallstones, and fruit pulp for constipation. Reported to be astringent and diuretic.
Nitrogen fixing: Widely grown with other species for its good nitrogen-fixing ability.
Intercropping: This leguminous shade tree is often planted with coffee."
Intsia bijuga,"Local names:
 English (Moluccan ironwood,Borneo teak), Fijian (vesi), Filipino (ipil laut,ipil), Indonesian (merbau asam), Malay (merbau ipil), Thai (pradu thale,maka-mong,lumpho-thale,lumpaw), Trade name (merbau), Vietnamese (go-nuoc,g[ox])
Intsia bijuga is a common medium-sized, unarmed tree of up to 35-(50) m in height. Mature trees have steep rounded buttresses which when fully developed can exceed 4 m. It has been suggested that these buttresses grant the Moluccan ironwood competitive advantage by preventing establishment of competing individuals in the space occupied by the buttresses. The bole can be crooked or straight but the crown is usually spreading and branchlets are glabrous.

Leaves paripinnate and semi-deciduous, leaflets 1-6 varying in shape from broadly ovate to obovate, oblong or subfalcate and thinly coriaceous.

Inflorescence 5-18 cm varying from very corymbiformly racemose to racemiform. Flowers white and arranged in dense terminal panicles. Bracts, bracteoles and calyx densely short-hairy to glabrous. Pedicels 1-2.25 cm, calyx-tube 7-15 mm segments 9-19 mm. Petals often red or pink in colour.

Fruit pod oblong or pear shaped, 8-23 cm x 4-8 cm. Pod leathery,woody and tardily dehiscent usually containing 1-9 seeds.

The genus Intsia has 7-9 species of tropical distribution. Intsia is closely related to Afzelia. It is difficult to assign sterile material to either genus. Intsia differs from Afzelia by its three fertile stamens, its flat seeds lacking an aril and its leathery pods. I. bijuga is the most widespread representative of the genus in the Malesian region. I. bijuga seems seriously threatened due to its overexploitation, however, its inclusion in Appendix II of CITES in 1992 was thwarted by Malaysia’s objection.
Ecology

I. bijuga is oftenly found on sand and coral beaches, but also features in periodically inundated localities further inland. It also occurs in dryland mangroves which are the final stage of mangrove forest succession and the transition to inland forests.
Native range
Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

The tree is tolerant to salt spray and soil salinity. However, ipil is susceptible to frost and moderately resistant to drought. Seedlings need high light intensity for optimal growth. Seedlings can be transplanted into the field after 3 months, at a spacing of 3m x 4m or 5m x 5m. The tree is slow growing and may attain maturity at 80 years. A 50-60 year rotation is recommended for natural stands.
Seeds of I. bijuga germinate well in full sunlight. Scarification is necessary because of the hard seed coat, the most effective scarification technique is by the use of a file to scrape off the small protrusion of the seed-coat located opposite the hilum. Immersion in concentrated sulphuric acid serves the same purpose. Treatment of scarified seeds with fungicides e.g. benlate or daconil may prevent fungal destruction. Seeds must be planted vertically with the hilum downward, so that the seed coat is shed as the hypocotyl emerges from the soil.
I. bijuga is oftenly found on sand and coral beaches, but also features in periodically inundated localities further inland. It also occurs in dryland mangroves which are the final stage of mangrove forest succession and the transition to inland forests.
Seed may be sown directly in the field. Propagation of bare root seedlings is popular, although stump cuttings have also been successfully used. Natural regeneration from fallen seed is good well in over logged areas. Vegetative propagation by means of 60 cm cuttings in the Philippines, had high mortality rates (62%).
Poison:  Seed oil of I. bijuga repels the stored products, tenebrionid pest Tribolium castaneum and compare favourably with neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts.
Ipil can be used to reclaim land degraded by gulley erosion.
Erosion control:  Ipil is a suitable tree for soil conservation in eroded gullies and in buffer strips along creeks.
  The seeds can be eaten after careful preparation, soaked in salt water for 3-4 days and then boiled.
Apiculture:  The flowers of the Mollucan ironwood are visited by pollinators for pollen and nectar.
The small branches of felled trees are used as firewood.
Timber:  U’ula timber is highly prized within the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Malaysia and is used for heavy construction for instance bridge making, power pole cross-arms, railway sleepers, boat building, house post beams and furniture. Other items made from the wood are walking sticks, food bowls, canoes and carvings. I. bijuga is used in constructing the main hull, masthead, maststep and steering oar of ocean-going canoes. Desirable properties of the timber are its strength, workability, satisfactory glueing, durability and its moderate resistance to ocean water. The wood does not shrink drastically on seasoning and has a density of 630-1 040 kg/cu m at 15% moisture content. The heartwood is durable (very difficult to treat with preservatives) and shows an average service life of 6-11.5 years in contact with the ground under tropical conditions and 20 years under temperate conditions. In experimental trials with small wood samples, I. bijuga was durable against the dry-wood termite Cryptotermes cynocephalus and the subterranean termite Coptotermes curvignathus.
Shade or shelter:  Ipil has an excellent shade suitable for homes and parks, the tree is wind tolerant thus ideal as a windbreak.
Tannin or dyestuff:  A brown dye is obtained from an oily substance present in the wood and bark.
Medicine:  The bark is used in treating persons suffering from a urinary condition (characterised by very dark urine). U’ula is also used in the treatment of rheumatism, dysentery and diarrhoea. An infusion of ipil bark is given to women after delivery.
Nitrogen fixing:  I. bijuga is confirmed to form nodules in published reports.
U’ula is such a reputed fence post provider that it was recommended in the early 1970’s by the Livestock Department, Solomon Islands for a fencing programme.
Soil improver:  The average total annual litter production in I. bijuga is, 8789.4 kg/ha with a high leaf litter decomposition rate. Initial tannin content of the leaf litter is the major chemical factor inhibiting decomposition. High uptake of Ca from the subsoil and its enrichment in the surface soil resulted in higher soil pH under I. bijuga.
Other services: In former times ipil was considered sacred in Fiji. The bowl for serving the esteemed traditional beverage, yagona, was made from ipil wood. 
Pollution control:  Ipil is used in water purification."
Irvingia gabonensis,"Local names:

Can be successfully propagated vegetatively by budding. Large-scale production of trees requires raising them in a nursery.
Wax: Contains waxes useful as an adjunct in making medicinal tablets.
Erosion control: Planted alongside other species to check soil erosion.
 Fruit pulp is palatable and can be used for a fruit drink and for jam production. The kernel can be processed into flour by extraction, drying and grinding. The pounded seed is added to meat and various vegetable dishes as a sauce. Margarine and cooking oil can be obtained from the kernels.
Fodder: Seeds are used as cattle cake in Ghana.
Timber: Wood pale brown, very hard and fine grained, not easy to cut, which limits its usefulness. Its weight precludes it from all but the most rugged construction work, e.g. for railway ties. Useful for making canoes and pestles for yam mortars; also suitable for boards, planking, ship decking and paving blocks.
Tannin or dyestuff: Reported to contain tannin in both bark and roots.
Lipids: Kernels contain oil used for making soaps, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
Medicine: Relieves diarrhoea and dysentery. Used internally as a purgative, for gastrointestinal and liver conditions, for sterility, hernias and urethral discharge, and is considered to be a powerful aphrodisiac."
Jacaranda mimosifolia,"Local names:
 Amharic (yetebmenja zaf), Creole (jakaranda,flabwayan ble), English (mimosa-leaved jacaranda,jacaranda,Brazilian rose wood), French (flambouyant bleu), Spanish (tarco,jacarandá,gualanolay,flamboyán azul), Tigrigna (palasandro)
Jacaranda mimosifolia is a deciduous tree up to 20 m in height with spreading branches making a light crown. Bark pale brown and furrowed, transverse cracks dividing the ridges between the furrows into long, narrow scales. The bole almost always short and malformed, and up to 40-50 cm in diameter. 

Leaves compound and feathery on a stalk to 40 cm; up to 30 pairs of pinnae bearing small, pointed leaflets.

Flowers striking blue-violet, in clusters, each flower bell shaped, to 4 cm, usually on the bare tree before leaf growth.

Fruit a rounded woody capsule to 7 cm across with a wavy edge, brown-black when mature, splitting on the tree to set free many light-winged seeds. Capsules may hang on the tree for up to 2 years.

The generic name is a latinized form of an aboriginal name used in Brazil.
Ecology

J. mimosifolia prefers highland areas but can also grow in some drier ones. It is frost tender when young. A deep-rooted, greedy feeder so that few plants or crops can grow below it; therefore, best planted away from flowerbeds. Leaf fall is also considerable.
Native range
Argentina, Brazil
Tree management

The plants need weeding for about 2 years after transplanting. Young trees should be staked until well rooted. They require regular watering. Very fast growing on good sites; up to 3 m/yr in height in the first 2 years and over 1 m/yr over the first 9 years. Established plants respond well to coppicing. If used as an ornamental roadside tree, wide spacing (over 5 m) is advisable. It is a light demander, and to flower prolifically it needs to be grown in the open.
Orthodox seed storage behaviour; viability is maintained for at least 12 months in open storage at room temperature. Seeds tolerate desiccation to moisture content in equilibrium with 15% rh at 25 deg. C, no loss in viability in subsequent storage in liquid nitrogen at -20 deg. C. There are about 59 000 seeds/kg.

Jacaranda can be raised from either seed or cuttings, the latter being more usual. The tree is a prolific seeder; no pretreatment is required; germination rate is 50-92%. Seeds should be sown fresh for best germination results; fresh seed soaked in water for 24 hours take 10-12 days for germination, which continues for 2 months. Planting should be from container stock during cool weather; 8-10 months should elapse before plants can be transplanted to the field. In avenues, planting may be done at 2 x 2 m or 3 x 3 m in well-manured 30-cubic cm pits. The plants can be raised from branch cuttings.
Apiculture: The relatively large flowers easily attract bees; therefore, it is suitable for bee forage.
J. mimosifolia provides useful firewood.
Timber: The timber is yellowish-white, hard, moderately heavy, fine textured, easy to work, and is used for carpentry. Wood is light brown and soft; it is used for poles and for making small items such as tool handles and carvings. Note that the wood associated with the timber trade name ‘jacaranda’ does not come from this tree but from Dalbergia nigra.
Shade or shelter: The tree creates pleasant open shade and can be used effectively as a screen or as a windbreak.
Medicine: Bark and roots are used for syphilis. Leaves also used as a vulnerary.
Ornamental: J. mimosifolia is widely grown throughout the highland tropics. When trees are not in flower, the finely cut foliage is also attractive, especially at close range."
Jatropha curcas,"Local names:

Jatropha curcas is a perennial, monoecious shrub or small tree up to 6 m high; bark pale brown, papery, peeling; slash exudes a copious watery latex, soapy to tough but soon becoming brittle and brownish when dry; branches glabrous, ascending, stout.

Leaves alternate, palmate, petiolate, stipulate; stipules minute; petiole 2-20 cm long, blade 3-5 lobed, 12.5-18 x 11-16 cm, lobes acute or shortly acuminate at the apex, margins entire or undulating, leaf base deeply cordate, glabrous or pubescent only on the veins below, basal veins 7-9, prominent, venation reticulate. 

Inflorescence a cyme formed terminally on branches and complex, possessing main and co-florescences with paracladia. The plant is monoecious and flowers are unisexual; occasionally hermaphroditic flowers occur; 10 stamens arranged in 2 distinct whorls of 5 each in a single column in the androecium and in close proximity to each other. In the gynaecium, the 3 slender styles are connate to about 2/3 of their length, dilating to a massive bifurcate stigma. Female flowers with sepals up to 18 mm long, persistent; ovary 3-locular, ellipsoid, 1.5-2 mm in diameter, style bifid.

Fruit an ellipsoid capsule 2.5-3 cm long, 2-3 cm in diameter, yellow, turning black. Seeds black, 2 per cell, ellipsoid, triangular-convex, 1.5-2 x 1-1.1 cm.

The meaning of the specific name ‘curcas’ is not known. It was first given 400 years ago to ‘certain seeds’ by the Portuguese doctor Garcia de Orto, who published a work on Indian medicinal and drug plants in 1563.
Ecology

As a succulent that sheds its leaves during the dry season, J. curcas is best adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions. Most Jatropha spp. occur in the following seasonally dry areas: grassland-savannah and thorn forest scrub but, are completely lacking from the moist Amazon region. The current distribution of J. curcas shows that introduction has been most successful in drier regions of the tropics. It is very tolerant and thrives under a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions. It is particularly hardy at medium altitude and in humid zones. It is not sensitive to day length.

J. curcas is a highly adaptable species, but its strength as a crop comes from its ability to grow on poor, dry sites. It is very drought tolerant and can withstand slight frost.
Native range
Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama
Tree management

Seedlings are susceptible to competition from weeds during their early development. Therefore weed control, either mechanical or with herbicides, is required during the establishment phase. Satisfactory planting widths are 2 x 2 m, 2.5 x 2.5 m, and 3 x 3 m. This is equivalent to crop densities of 2500, 1600 and 1111 plants/ha, respectively. Under good rainfall conditions, nursery plants bear fruit after the 1st rainy season, while directly seeded plants bear for the 1st time after the 2nd rainy season. With vegetative propagation, the 1st seed yield is higher. At least 2-3 t of seeds/ha can be achieved in semi-arid areas. 

Live fences can be established quickly by planting cuttings directly in the field. Pruning as a hedge is a frequent practice. J. curcas has a productive life of 40-50 years without necessitating replanting or tending.
Seeds are oily and do not store for long. Seeds older than 15 months show viability below 50%. High levels of viability and low levels of germination shortly after harvest indicate innate (primary) dormancy.

J. curcas is a highly adaptable species, but its strength as a crop comes from its ability to grow on poor, dry sites. It is very drought tolerant and can withstand slight frost.
The species is easily propagated by direct seeding, precultivation of seedlings, transplanting of spontaneous wild plants and direct planting of cuttings. Seed should be collected when capsules split open. Use of fresh seeds improves germination. Intervals of presoaking and drying, or partial removal of the testa, are more successful than presoaking alone. With good moisture conditions, germination takes 10 days. The seed shell splits, the radicula emerges and 4 small peripheral roots are formed. Soon after development of the 1st leaves, the cotyledons wither and fall off. Further growth is sympodial.
Wax: The bark contains a wax composed of a mixture of ‘melissyl alcohol’ and its melissimic acid ester.
Poison: Curcas oil contains a toxin, curcasin. The albumen of the kernel is a poison, toxalbumen cursin, most abundant in the embryo. Another poison, a croton resin, occurs in the seeds and causes redness and pustular eruptions of the skin. The plant is listed as a fish poison. Aqueous extracts of J. curcas leaves were effective in controlling Sclerotium spp., an Azolla fungal pathogen. The seed oil, extracts of J. curcas seeds and phorbol esters from the oil have been used to control various pests, often with successful results. In Gabon, the seeds, ground and mixed with palm oil, are used to kill rats. The oil has purgative properties, but seeds are poisonous; even the remains from pressed seeds can be fatal.
Erosion control: In Cape Verde, J. curcas was recently planted in arid areas for soil-erosion control.
 In Guinea, ashes from the roots and branches are used as cooking salt. Young leaves may be safely eaten when steamed or stewed. Cooked nuts are eaten in certain regions of Mexico
Jatropha oil is an environmentally safe, cost-effective renewable source of non-conventional energy and a promising substitute for diesel, kerosene and other fuels. Physic nut oil was used in engines in Segou, Mali, during World War II. The oil burns without smoke and has been employed for street lighting near Rio de Janeiro. Fruit hulls and seed shells can be used as a fuel. Dried seeds dipped into palm oil are used as torches, which will keep alight even in a strong wind. The wood was used as fuel, though of poor quality, in Cape Verde.
Tannin or dyestuff: Leaf juice stains red and marks linen an indelible black. The 37% tannin found in bark is said to yield a dark blue dye; latex also contains 10% tannin and can be used as marking ink. Ashes from the roots and branches are used in the dyeing industry, and pounded seeds in tanning in Ghana. 
Lipids: The seeds yield up to 31-37% of a valuable oil. It is used to prepare varnish after calcination with iron oxides. Hardened physic nut oil could be a satisfactory substitute for tallow or hardened rice bran oil. In Europe it is used in wool spinning and textile manufacture. Along with burnt plantain ashes, oil is used in making hard homemade soap.
Medicine: Seeds were formerly exported from the Cape Verde Islands to Portugal and the ‘curcas’, or purging oil, from them is a drastic purgative. They resemble groundnuts in flavour, and 15-20 seeds will cause griping, purging and vomiting for 30 minutes. It is reported from Gabon that 1-2 roasted seeds are sufficient to act as a purgative; larger doses may be dangerous. The seeds have been substituted for castor oil and are sometimes called ‘larger castor oil’. The oil is widely used for skin diseases and to soothe pain such as that caused by rheumatism; it is an ingredient in the oily extract, known in Hausa as ‘kufi’, which is a rubifacient for rheumatism and for parasitic skin conditions. The oil is used to stimulate hair growth. The seeds are also used in the treatment of syphilis.  Juice or latex is applied directly to wounds and cuts as a styptic and astringent to clean teeth, gums, and to treat sores on the tongue and in the mouth. Branches are used as a chewing stick in Nigeria. Latex has antibiotic properties against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogens. It also has coagulating effects on blood plasma. A methanol extract of physic nut leaves afforded moderate protection for cultured human lymphoblastoid cells against the cytopathic effects of the human immunodeficiency virus. Preparations of the plant, including seeds, leaves and bark, fresh or as a decoction, are used in traditional medicine and for veterinary purposes. A leaf infusion is used as a diuretic, for bathing, to treat coughs, and as an enema in treating convulsions and fits. Leaves are also used to treat jaundice, fevers, rheumatic pains, guinea worm sores and poor development of the fetus in pregnant women. The leaves produce a sap that has haemostatic properties; it is used to dress wounds. In Ghana the ashes from the burnt leaves are applied by rectal injection for haemorrhoids. The root bark is used to relieve the spasms of infantile tetanus and is used for sores, dysentery and jaundice. The juice of the flowers has numerous medicinal qualities.
Widely cultivated in the tropics as a living fence in fields and settlements. J. curcas is not browsed by cattle; it can grow without protection and can be used as a hedge to protect fields.
Soil improver: Press cake cannot be used in animal feed because of its toxic properties, but it is valuable as organic manure due to a nitrogen content similar to that of seed cake from castor bean and chicken manure.  The nitrogen content ranges from 3.2 to 3.8%, depending on the source. Tender branches and leaves are used as a green manure for coconut trees. All plant parts can be used as a green manure.
Intercropping: In Madagascar, the plant is used as a support for vanilla."
Juniperus procera,"Local names:
 Amharic (tid,tedh), Arabic (arar), English (pencil cedar,East African pencil cedar,East African cedar,cedar,African pencil cedar), Swahili (mwangati), Tigrigna (tsihdi), Trade name (cedar,African pencil cedar)
Juniperus procera is an afro-montane tree often reaching 30-35 m high; can reach 50 m,  actually the largest tree of its genus. Bole straight but sharply tapered, often with a pronounced twist, commonly heavily fluted, reaches 2-3 m dbh. Bark pale brown to reddish-brown, thin, fibrous, with thin shallow longitudinal fissures, exfoliating in thin papery strips.

Leaves grey or glaucous when mature, about 1 mm long, acute, hooded and keeled at the apex, and with a narrow translucent margin and an elliptic oil gland on the back near the base. Juvenile leaves deciduous, in whorls of 3 on shoots, 1-2 cm long, linear and spine tipped, lower part decurrent on the branch, oil gland on abaxial surface, linear, extending 75% of the leaf length. As plant ages, the leaves gradually change until foliage characteristic of mature tree is produced.

Inflorescence a dioecious cone. Male cones solitary, terminal on short branchlets, small (about 3 mm long), ellipsoid to subglobose, yellowish, consisting of 5-6 pairs of decussate, subpeltate, obtuse or blunt apiculate scales, each with 2-3 pollen sacs. Female cones solitary, terminal, on short lateral shoots, consisting of 3-4 pairs decussate fleshy scales and bearing a solitary erect ovule.

Fruit berrylike, globose or subglobose, reddish-brown to blue-black, waxy, composed of confluent, swollen, fleshy scales with distinguishable tips on female cone, 4-8 mm diameter when ripe, containing up to 4 brown seeds about 5 mm long, with a woody testa, each flattened or triangular. Additional 1-3 smaller aborted seeds are common.

Juniperus is the classical Latin name of the junipers, from the Celtic word for rough, referring to the texture of the bark. The specific name, ‘procera’, is Latin for tall or high.
Ecology

J. procera and J. excelsa make up a closely related species pair, which together cover a distribution area largely coinciding with that of Olea europaea ssp cuspidata; it is also associated with Podocarpus falcatus. It is an important component of forest that is transitional between dry, single-dominant afro-montane forest and semi-evergreen bushland and thicket. J. procera will not regenerate in mature forest but is replaced by Podocarpus forest and similar forest types. The species is susceptible to fire.
Native range
Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Republic of, Zimbabwe
Tree management

J. procera can be grown in plantations, in homesteads or on boundaries. Weeding has to be carried out at least once in a year during the early stages of growth. Early pruning should take place following 3-6 years of establishment. First thinning is done in the 5th year, when about 50% of the stems should be removed. Due to the acidic substances released from the decomposing leaves, which are harmful to crops, intercropping is not recommended.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 7-8% mc. There are about 40 000-50 000 seeds/kg. Due to the hard seed coat, hot water or acid pretreatment is recommended; immersing the seed in hot water at 100 deg. C, for 1 minute or soaking in sulphuric acid for 10 minutes increases germination rate. Stratification in damp sand at 3 deg. C for 60 days is another alternative. On average, mature and pretreated seeds have a germination rate of 60-70% within 25-80 days.

Established through seeds and wildings. Seedlings take 1-2 years in the nursery before they are ready for planting out. Close initial spacing of 2 x 2 m is recommended to limit the crown level.
Apiculture: Older trees are usually hollow and can be used in making beehives.
Wood burns quite well hence a useful species for firewood.
Fibre: The wood is suitable for making hardboard and particleboard.
Timber: The wood is fine textured, straight-grained and of medium hardness, difficult to season, rather brittle at the edges; it splits on nailing, is durable, easy to work and polish, and whittles and glues well. Mainly used for construction, power transmission posts, fencing and telegraphic poles, manufacturing pencils, furniture. Cedar wood has a distinctive smell. Heartwood resistant to termite attack.
Shade or shelter: The spreading crown of the tree forms a suitable shade.
Lipids: Cedar wood oil distilled from sawdust is used in the cosmetic industry to manufacture perfumes.
Medicine: The bark and leaves are used for medicinal purposes.
Ornamental: The species is a frequently planted as an ornamental tree.

Khaya ivorensis,"Local names:
 English (Nigerian mahogany,Ivory Coast mahogany,Gold Coast mahogany,African mahogany), French (acajoud’Afrique,acajou), German (rotes-Khaya,mahagoni), Indonesian (kaya), Trade name (African mahogany)
Khaya ivorensis is a very large tree that attains a height of 40-50 m and a dbh of up to 2 m. Bole straight, unbranched up to 30 m above the ground with well-developed plank buttresses; bark thick and coarse, reddish-brown, and with a bitter taste. The foliage of the widely spreading crown is dark. 

Leaves are evenly pinnate, with 4-7 pairs of leaflets, 7.5-14 cm long by 2.5-4.5 cm broad, oblong, abruptly long-acuminate at the apex (the tip very long and conspicuous in seedling and saplings); stalk of leaflets about 4 mm long.

Flowers very many, small, white, in panicles at the ends of branchlets.

Fruits rounded woody capsules usually with 5 valves, each valve 7.5-8.5 cm long and 2.5-4 mm thick, thinner than those of K. grandifoliola; when fully ripe, the valves open to release about 15 flat-winged seeds, each about 2.5 cm in diameter and narrowly winged all round.
Ecology

K. ivorensis is deciduous only in drier climates. Scattered specimens can be found in semi-deciduous lowland rainforest, usually with a short dry season. It occurs either in small groups or singly, for the most part on moist valley sites. It tolerates periodic flooding during the rainy season. In evergreen forests, it favours soils with a low water-storage capacity. K. ivorensis is a light-demanding species, although the young trees tolerate a certain amount of shade. The species is distributed through coastal West Africa, Cote d’Ivoire through Ghana and southern Nigeria to Cameroon, growing mostly in rainforest but extending into dry forests.
Native range
Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo
Tree management

Planting has been done with some success within its natural habitat. Because of insect damage, pure stands are rarely planted; instead, they are planted with mixed stands and with close spacing. K. ivorensis grows very quickly; for example in Cote d’Ivoire, 4-year-old trees attained heights of 7-13 m with an annual growth increment of 2.3 m and a diameter growth of 2.5 cm/yr. In Malaysia, a final density of 80 trees/ha and a rotation of about 30 years in mixed plantations are recommended. Light requirement for optimal development is 50-90% of full daylight. The stem form is variable, and strong lateral competition is needed to obtain straight and upright trunks.
There is a rapid loss of seed viability. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seeds tolerate desiccation to 6% mc, 44% germinate following 2 years subsequent hermetic storage at 2 deg. C. There are 3200-7600 seeds/kg.

The species is distributed through coastal West Africa, Cote d’Ivoire through Ghana and southern Nigeria to Cameroon, growing mostly in rainforest but extending into dry forests.
Natural regeneration is poor. The germination percentage of fresh seeds is very high (about 90%), but it is maintained for only 2 weeks at the most, falling off quickly afterwards. When sown in seedbeds, the seeds germinate after 11-21 days. Germination is epigeal; the young seedlings grow very slowly and must be kept shaded at the beginning. Stock can be planted to the field when 60-90 cm high, usually as stumps or striplings.
Timber: The sapwood is yellowish-brown, and the heartwood, which is not always readily distinguishable from the former, is pale reddish-brown. The wood is durable and has a fine fairly regular grain; it is easy to work and season but is difficult to impregnate. It has a mean specific gravity of 0.53 g/cubic m. The wood commands a very high price on the market, and is used above all for high-quality cabinet work, furniture and expensive interior finishing. Large quantities are also used for boat and ship construction. A high percentage of the wood sold in Europe as ‘mahogany’ comes from K. ivorensis.
Medicine: Bitter bark used for coughs and whooping cough. When mixed with black peppercorns, used to treat diarrhoea and dysentery. A bark decoction is used as a drink or bath for back pains and as a lotion for rheumatism.
Soil improver: K. ivorensis has been used for enrichment planting."

Flowers white, up to 10 mm in diameter, sweetly scented, inconspicuous, produced in large, many-flowered, axillary, branched sprays or panicles. 

Fruit an ovoid woody capsule, 3-5 cm in diameter, creamy brown, splitting into 4-5 valves; seeds winged.

The specific epithet is after nyasaland (now Malawi) where this splendid tree was collected for scientific identification.
Ecology

East African mahogany prefers terraces and stable, gently sloping riverbeds in riparian forests; it also grows well on adjacent colluvial slopes at the margins of floodplains. Where sufficient moisture is available, the species is not limited by topographic position. It is frost sensitive and shares the dominant canopy position with Diospyros mespiliformis, Parinari excelsa and Syzygium cordatum. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, it grows in well-developed gallery forests with Chrysophyllum species.
Native range
Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia
Tree management

No guidelines exist for stocking in natural forest. Since natural East African mahogany is probably best managed in mixed stands, a few hundred seedlings/ha on the ground and a few 10s of saplings free to grow later should be satisfactory. Periodic weeding is necessary after planting, as it is sensitive to competition from weeds, grass and brush. It coppices poorly.
Seed capsules are clipped from trees when the capsules begin to split. The capsules are sun dried until they split and then shelled by hand. The seed is further dried and then stored in sealed containers in a refrigerator, because viability is lost quickly at ambient air temperatures. Seed storage behaviour is intermediate. Seeds store well in cool places. There are 2000-3800 seeds/kg.

K. senegalensis has been successfully planted as bare root and as stumps. Use of containerized seedlings yields better results. Germination of fresh seed can sometimes be nearly 100% and begins in about 3 weeks. Propagation by seedlings or wildings is also possible. Asexual reproduction techniques have not been developed.
Suitable for firewood.
Timber: Used for framing, panelling and veneer. Large logs are used to make dugout canoes. 
Shade or shelter: Casts a dense shade, hence suitable as a shade tree.
Medicine: Bark infusions containing a bitter substance are drunk to treat colds and oil from the seeds is rubbed into the hair to kill lice.
Ornamental: Used as an ornamental tree because of its dense canopy."
Khaya senegalensis,"Local names:

Khaya senegalensis is a deciduous evergreen tree, 15-30 m high, up to 1 m in diameter, with a clean bole to 8-16 m, buttresses not prominent or absent; bark dark grey, with small, thin, reddish-tinged scales; slash dark pink to bright crimson, exuding a red sap.
 
Leaves alternate, compound, stipules absent; petiole and rachis 13-33 cm long; leaflets 3-4 (max. 7) usually opposite pairs, oblong to narrowly oblong-elliptic, 4-12 x 2-5 cm, apex acute to shortly acuminate, base rounded, margins entire, pale green, lateral nerves 8-16, petiolules about 3.5 cm long. 

Inflorescence a lax, much-branched axillary panicle up to 17 cm long; flowers tetramerous, monoecious but with well-developed vestiges of those of the opposite sex with very little external differences between sexes. Calyx pale green, lobed almost to the base, lobes subcircular, about 1 x 1 mm, imbricate; petals cream, free, oblong-ovate, 4 x 2.5 mm, contorted in bud; orange disk around the ovary. 

Fruit an upright, almost spherical, woody capsule, 4-6 cm in diameter, opening by 4 valves from the apex (a distinction from K. ivorensis, which is closely related but has 5 valves). Seeds brown, 6 or more per cell, broadly transversely ellipsoid to flat, about 25 x 18 mm, margins narrowly winged. 
The specific name means ‘of Senegal’, which is where the type specimen was collected.
Ecology

K. senegalensis occurs in riverine forests and is scattered within the higher-rainfall savannah woodlands. In moister areas, K. senegalensis is found on uplands, but it is restricted to riparian habitats or stream bottoms that extend into the savannah in the drier portions of the range. During the 1st year, the seedling develops a strong, deep taproot, which makes it the most drought hardy of all the Khaya species. It is also very resistant to flooding and can be considered for planting on swampy soils. Moderately shade tolerant. Except where selectively removed by logging, dry-zone mahogany remains a dominant species in most of its range.

Successful plantations of dry-zone mahogany in other parts of the world have generally been in areas with short dry seasons and high rainfall.

Tree management

Strategies to obtain sufficient regeneration on poor sites should include liberation cutting of stands with advanced regeneration. Common spacings on cleared and prepared sites are 5 x 5 m and 5 x 10 m. A spacing of 5 x 20 m is used when planting in riparian forests. Hoeing and weeding are recommended at the onset of the dry season. K. senegalensis coppices well. Although older trees are resistant to fire, seedlings are fairly susceptible.
Seed storage behaviour is intermediate; seeds tolerate desiccation to 6% mc; 81% germinate following 3 years of subsequent storage at 2 deg. C; seeds tolerate desiccation to 5.7% mc (in equilibrium with 54.4% rh), little loss (about 3%) on desiccation to 2.1% mc (in equilibrium with 11.8% rh at 20 deg. C), complete loss in viability following 24 months of hermetic storage at 10 deg. C, 0 deg. C and -20 deg. C with 10% mc; it appears to 0 deg. C is optimal storage temperature for seeds at 2.2-5.6% mc, whereas -20 deg. C is damaging. Normally there are 6000-7000 seed/kg, but occasionally as few as 3000.

Successful plantations of dry-zone mahogany in other parts of the world have generally been in areas with short dry seasons and high rainfall.
Natural regeneration from seed is poor, although it grows from pretreated seed and transplants well. Seed yield is usually heavy. Germination is epigeal, about 90% of fresh seed germinate within 18 days. Seedlings can survive light to moderate shade. Containerized stock is best; however, bare-root and stump plantings give satisfactory results. Reproduction may also occur from root suckers. 

Establishment of new seedlings can be encouraged by disturbances such as cultivation or prescribed fire just before seed fall. After seedlings have emerged, a partial cut applied to allow light to reach the forest floor improves seedling establishment well before the final harvest of the existing stand.
Poison: K. senegalensis is used in Cote d’Ivoire as an ingredient in arrow poison. Bark scales are sometimes used as a fish poison.
It largely reproduces itself from suckers and is recommended for reforestation purposes.
Fodder: Young leaves contain fairly large amounts of digestible crude protein. The leaves are used as a fodder for cattle and camels, although they are not very palatable.
Only limited quantities are available for fuelwood, and trees of larger dimensions are undesirable because of difficulties with splitting and crosscutting. Hence, even if fuelwood is in short supply, larger-diameter sections are not utilized. The gross energy value of the wood is 19 990 kJ/kg.
Fibre: The wood is used in West Africa for pulp.
Timber: One of the hardest African mahoganies and the hardest of the Khaya species. It is widely used on a commercial scale, particularly in West Africa. The wood density ranges from 0.6 to 0.85, depending on locality. The sapwood is pinkish-tan in colour and the heartwood an attractive dark red-brown. It is moderately resistant to fungi, insects and termites. The sapwood is moderately resistant to preservation treatment, the heartwood extremely so. The timber saws well except for a tendency to be woolly in cross grain. It seasons rapidly, with little degradation; however, tension may occasionally cause splitting and warping. It is favoured for furniture, high-class joinery, trim and boat building. The wood is also used locally for railroad ties, flooring, turnery and veneer. Because of its decorative appearance, the wood of K. senegalensis is a very popular timber.
Tannin or dyestuff: The bark is used in tanning. 
Lipids: The seeds have an oil content of 67% and are rich in oleic acid (66%). The oil is used in West Africa for cooking.
Medicine: The very bitter bark has a considerable reputation in its natural range as a fever remedy. The bark is also used as a vermifuge, taenicide, depurative and for treating syphilis. Bark extract is used for treating jaundice, dermatoses, scorpion bite, allergies, infection of the gums, hookworm, bleeding wounds (disinfectant), and as a laxative. Seeds and leaves are used for treating fever, headache; roots against sterility, for the treatment of mental illness, against syphilis, leprosy and as an aphrodisiac. Crushed bark and seeds are regarded as emmenagogue. Bark also used in traditional veterinary practice, for example for cattle suffering from liver fluke, for ulcers in camels, donkeys and horses, and in horses for internal ailments associated with mucous diarrhoea.
Gum or resin: The presence of oleoresin in the vessels of Khaya species accounts for the durability of the timber and its resistance to insect and fungal attack.
Ornamental: Dry-zone mahogany is an important urban tree in West Africa."

Kigelia africana is a medium to large tree, up to 25 m in height, with a dense rounded crown; bark grey, generally smooth in large specimens, flaking in thin, round patches.

Leaves opposite, crowded near the ends of branches, compound, with 3-5 pairs of leaflets plus a terminal leaflet; leaflets oblong, up to 6 x 10 cm, leathery, roughly hairy on both surfaces, rather yellowish-green above, paler green below, apex broadly tapering to rounded; base square, asymmetric in the lateral leaflets, symmetric in the terminal leaflet; margin entire, sometimes obscurely toothed, wavy; the lower leaflets shortly petiolulate, the terminal pair without petiolules; petiole up to 15 cm long.

Flowers striking, dark maroon with heavy yellow veining on the outside, cup shaped, asymmetric, up to 15 cm across the mouth, unpleasant smelling; in 6- to 12-flowered, lax, pendulous sprays up to 90 cm long. Calyx shortly tubular with 2-5 ribbed lobes; corolla widely cup shaped with 5 broad spreading lobes; stamens 4, slightly protruding beyond the mouth of the corolla tube; ovary 1-chambered.

Fruit very unusual, sausage shaped, up to 1 m x 18 cm, greyish-brown, heavily dotted with lenticels, indehiscent, heavy, weighing up to 12 kg, containing a fibrous pulp in which are embedded many seeds.

The common name ‘sausage tree’ is derived from the cylindrical shape of the fruit. Kigelia is the latinized version of a Mozambique name and ‘africana’ means simply ‘from Africa’.
Ecology

A tree widespread in Africa, found primarily in wet savannah woodland spreading into gallery woodland and along rivers in moist forests. In open woodland and in riverine fringes, it occurs at low altitudes.

Tree management

K. africana is a relatively slow-growing tree; depending on the climate, it reaches good shade proportions in 4-5 years. The growth rate is at least 1 m/year, but it is slower in colder areas. It is not frost resistant, but if young plants are protected for the 1st 2-3 years from cold winds in colder areas, they will survive.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability is maintained for more than 3 years in hermetic storage at ambient temperature with 11-15% mc; dry seeds store well in a cool place. There are approximately 9700 seeds/kg.
A tree widespread in Africa, found primarily in wet savannah woodland spreading into gallery woodland and along rivers in moist forests. In open woodland and in riverine fringes, it occurs at low altitudes.
Seedlings and wildings are possible material for propagation. The sausage tree is not a prolific seeder. Seeds are released when fruit rots on the ground, and plants regenerate naturally. Seeds are placed in seedling trays filled with pure river sand; they are pressed into the sand until the tip is level with the sand, covered lightly with a thin layer of sand or pure compost and kept moist. Seed usually germinate after 10-25 days. No pretreatment is needed, but germination rate is poor.
Poison: The fruit extract is reported to have molluscicidal properties. Raw fruit are poisonous to humans.
Erosion control: The sausage tree is suitable for riverbank stabilization.
 Ripe fruits are inedible, although slices of baked fruit are added to beer to aid in fermentation of local honey beer, for example throughout East Africa. In times of food shortage, the seeds are roasted in hot ashes and eaten.
Fodder: When the flowers and leaves fall to the ground they are eaten by game and livestock.
Apiculture: The large, maroon flowers attract bees and are a source of bee forage.
Timber: Wood is moderately heavy (air-dry 720 kg/cubic m). The wood is easy to work and produces a good-quality timber for general use. The sapwood is whitish or yellow and, although rather soft, has been used for planking, yokes, fruit boxes and shelving. Heartwood is light brown and is used for drums, utensils and cutlery. In South Africa, inhabitants of the areas along larger rivers, especially the Chobe and Zambezi, make their dugout canoes from K. africana.
Shade or shelter: K. africana makes a good shade tree, casting dense shade, though it is not advisable to park a vehicle or to put up a tent underneath a sausage tree during the fruiting period. The ‘sausages’ that drop every so often weigh up to 12 kg an
Tannin or dyestuff: A black dye can be produced from the fruit. Tannin can be extracted from the roots and stem bark.
Medicine: Bark and leaves are used for bladder trouble/kidney disease, an enema or drink of the boiled root and stem bark for piles; wounds, sores and cuts are treated with a leaf and bark decoction or bark; bark and leaf decoctions are antidotes for snakebite. The unripe fruits are said to be poisonous but are taken as a remedy for syphilis and rheumatism, and boiled fruit is massaged into the body for lumbago. In South Africa, the fruits are used as a dressing for ulcers or to increase the flow of milk in lactating women. In northern Nigeria, the fruit is used in some districts as a purgative, and in others to treat dysentery. The leaf alone, or with other ingredients, is useful for diarrhoea and dysentery. The fruits and bark, ground and boiled in water, are taken either orally or as an enema in treating children’s stomach ailments. The fruits and roots of K. africana are boiled along with the stem and tassels of a plantain for postpartum haemorrhage. Decoctions of the stem bark are used for spleen infection, gonorrhoea and syphilis. A cream made from fruit extract is used to remove sunspots known as ‘solar keratosis’, particularly on the face and hands.
Ornamental: With its fast growth rate, spreading canopy and interesting flowers and fruits, it makes a good street tree and is popular for this purpose in various towns in the countries north of South Africa and in Australia. It can be used successfully for bonsai, the thick stem being an attractive feature.
Other services: In Nigeria pieces of fruit soaked in water, together with small pieces of metal are sprinkled with young palm fronds, stimulate the germination of yam tubers as well as promote a good harvest."

Flowers in a large, axillary or terminal panicle, often showy, calyx funnel or bell shaped, 6(9) lobed, petals often 6, inserted near the mouth of the calyx tube, white to pink or purple, clawed, wrinkled, stamens many, in several rows, ovary superior, 3-6 locular with many ovules in each cell, style 1.

Fruit a large woody capsule on the persistent calyx.

Seed with an apical wing.

The generic name commemorates M. Lagerstroem, 1691-1759, a Swedish patron of science and the specific epithet 'speciosa' is a Latin word for showy, referring to the flowers.
Ecology

It is found at low to medium altitudes in comparatively open habitats, in disturbed or secondary forest, grassland, and along rivers. The habitat may vary from well drained to occasionally flooded but not peat soil. It is resistant to fire.
Native range
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

In trials in Java, 15-year-old trees attained a mean annual increment of 0.9-1.1 cm in diameter and 0.7-0.9 m in height. In trials at 3 m x 1 m on fertile soil in Java the canopy closed after 6 years and the first thinning was necessary after 8 years. Due to poor natural pruning a spacing of 2.5 m x 1 m is recommended. At 15.5 years the clear bole yield in the trial was 47-55 m cu/ha. It has been proposed to girdle trees 2 years before harvest to allow for easier seasoning. The tree coppices freely and is fairly resistant to fire.
There are 165 000-235 000 seeds/kg. Seed storage behaviour appears to be orthodox. Viability maintained after 2 years hermetic storage at room temperature. Germination increases during the first 3-12 months of storage (Hong et.al, 1996).
It is found at low to medium altitudes in comparatively open habitats, in disturbed or secondary forest, grassland, and along rivers. The habitat may vary from well drained to occasionally flooded but not peat soil. It is resistant to fire.
The tree can be propagated by seed. Branch and root cuttings have been used occasionally and tissue culture has been successful on an experimental scale. Seeds should be sown in the shade, germination takes 15-56 days. After germination the small seedlings can be pricked out and transferred to containers. Stumps with a shoot length of 5-10 cm, a root length of 10-20 cm and a diameter of 5-25 mm have shown 90-100 % survival.
Poison:  Roots, stems and leaves contain hydrocyanic acid.
The tree has been used in reforestation of degraded hills in Java.
Erosion control:  Due to the tree’s dense and widespreading root system, it is used in erosion control.
The gross energy value of L. speciosa wood is 18 855-19 230 kJ/kg.
Timber:  The medium-weight hardwood  has a density of 505-810 kg/cu m at 15 % moisture content. Heartwood pale brown, yellow-brown, greyish or reddish to red-brown, not differentiated from the white or grey-white to yellow-brown, up to 8 cm wide sapwood. Grain straight or slightly interlocked, occasionally conspicuously wavy, texture moderately fine to rather coarse, lustrous. The timber is resistant to termites.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Bark, fruit (14-17 %) and leaves (12-13 %) contain tannin.
Lipids: Seeds of L. speciosa yield an oil whose main constituents are linoleic (54.3%), a keto (9-ketooctadec-cis-11-enoic acid, 21.1%), oleic (10.3%), palmitic (9.7%) and stearic (4.6%).
Medicine:  A decoction of the bark is used against diarrhoea and abdominal pains. A leaf poultice is used to relief malarial fever and is applied on cracked feet. A preparation from dried leaves, known as banaba, is widely used in the Philippines to treat diabetes and urinary problems.
Ornamental:  L. spciosa  is cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a roadside tree.
The tree is used as a support for rattan."
Lansium domesticum,"Local names:
 Burmese (duku,langsak), English (Langsat,duku), Filipino (lanzone,lanzon,lansones,lansone,buahan), Indonesian (duku,kokosan,langsat), Malay (langseh,langsep,lansa), Thai (duku,longkong,langsat), Vietnamese (bòn-bon)
Lansium domesticum is an erect, short-trunked, slender or spreading, reaching 10-15 m in height, with red-brown or yellow-brown, furrowed bark.

Leaves pinnate, 22.5-50 cm long, with 5-7 alternate leaflets, obovate or elliptic-oblong, pointed at both ends, 7-20 cm long, slightly leathery, dark-green and glossy on the upper surface, paler and dull beneath, and with prominent midrib.

Flowers small, white or pale-yellow, fleshy, mostly bisexual, borne in simple or branched racemes which may be solitary or in hairy clusters on the trunk and oldest branches, at first standing erect and finally pendant, 10-30 cm long.

Fruits borne 2-30 in a cluster, oval, ovoid-oblong or nearly round, 2.5-5 cm in diameter, and have light greyish-yellow to pale brownish or pink, velvety skin, leathery, thin or thick, and containing milky latex. There are 5 or 6 segments of aromatic, white, translucent, juicy flesh (arils), acid to subacid in flavour.

Seeds, which adhere more or less to the flesh, are usually present in 1 to 3 of the segments. They are green, relatively large, 2-2.5 cm long and 1.25-2 cm wide, very bitter, and sometimes, if the flesh clings tightly to the seed, it may acquire some of its bitterness. 

There are two distinct botanical varieties; var. pubescens, the typical wild langsat which is a rather slender, open tree with hairy branchlets and nearly round, thick-skinned fruits having much milky latex and var. domesticum, called the duku, doekoe, or dookoo, which is a more robust tree, broad-topped and densely foliaged with conspicuously-veined leaflets; the fruits, borne few to a cluster, are oblong-ovoid or ellipsoid, with thin, brownish skin, only faintly aromatic and containing little or no milky latex. The former is often referred to as the wild type but both varieties are cultivated and show considerable range of form, size and quality. There are desirable types in both groups. Some small fruits are completely seedless and fairly sweet.
Ecology

The langsat is ultra-tropical. It is a tree of tropical lowland forest and is damaged by frost. Even in its native territory it cannot be grown at an altitude over 650-750 m. It needs a humid atmosphere, plenty of moisture and will not tolerate long dry seasons. Some shade is beneficial especially during the early years. In Java the tree grows in areas with 6-12 wet months if there is over 100 mm rainfall monthly.
Native range
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines
Tree management

The trees are spaced 8-10 m apart in orchards. Generally, the langsat is casually grown in dooryards and on roadsides and receives no cultural attention. Regular irrigation results in better fruit size and heavier crops. Thrice-yearly applications of a 6-6-6 fertilizer formula with added minor elements result in good growth, productivity and high quality fruits even in an adverse environment. In the Philippines, a productive tree averages 1 000 fruits per year, where it is grown in half shade interplanted with coconut. Seedlings will bear in 12-20 years.
Seeds are recalcitrant and viability can only be maintained for about 5 weeks if kept moist. Viability is totally lost in 8 days unless fresh seeds are stored in polyethylene bags at 4-6 deg C where they will remain viable for 14 days.

In Java the tree grows in areas with 6-12 wet months if there is over 100 mm rainfall monthly.
Langsats are commonly grown from seeds, which must be planted within 1-2 days after removal from the fruit. Cleft-, side- and approach-grafting give good results. The budwood should be mature but not old, 6.5-9 cm long, 6-20 mm thick, and it is joined to rootstock of the same diameter about 6.5-10 cm above the soil.
Poison: An arrow poison is made from the fruit peel and the bark of the tree. Both possess a toxic property, lansium acid, which, on injection, arrests heartbeat in frogs. The seed contains a minute amount of an unnamed alkaloid and 2 bitter, toxic principles. The dried peel is burned in Java, the aromatic smoke serving as a mosquito repellent and as incense in the rooms of sick people.
The tree is used in reforestation of hilly areas.
 The peel of the langsat is easily removed and the flesh is commonly eaten out-of-hand or served as dessert, and may be cooked in various ways. Varieties with much latex are best dipped into boiling water to eliminate the gumminess before peeling. The peeled, seedless or seeded fruits are canned in syrup or sometimes candied.
Timber: The wood is light-brown, medium-hard, fine-grained, tough, elastic and durable, weighing 840 kg/ cu m. It is utilized in Java for house posts, rafters, tool handles and small utensils. Wood tar, derived by distillation, is employed to blacken the teeth.
Tannin or dyestuff: The peel is reportedly high in tannin.
Medicine: The resin is non-toxic and administered to halt diarrhoea and intestinal spasms. The pulverized seed is employed as a febrifuge and vermifuge. The bark is poulticed on scorpion stings. An astringent bark decoction is taken as a treatment for dysentery and malaria. Leaves may be combined with the bark in preparing the decoction. The leaf juice is used as eye-drops to dispel inflammation.
Gum or resin: The seed contains a minute amount of an unnamed alkaloid and 1% of an alcohol-soluble resin. The fresh peel contains a brown resin and reducing acids, from the dried peel, a dark, semi-liquid oleoresin composed of 0.17 % volatile oil and 22%
In the Philippines they are frequently planted around the edges of coconut plantations.
Essential oil: The fresh peel contains 0.2% of a light-yellow volatile oil, from the dried peel, a dark, semi-liquid oleoresin composed of 0.17 % volatile oil and 22% resin is obtained."

Tree management

Young plants must be protected from browsing animals and can be watered to increase growth rate. Fields are hoed once or twice in a year and weeded when required. Trees should be spaced at 15 cm within a row, with distance between the rows varying according to the production area; a dense spacing that gives up to 200 000 plants/ha can be employed. Under intensive commercial production, as in North Africa, the crop is irrigated during the dry season and heavily fertilized. In India, it is grown on a larger scale but less intensively, often without irrigation, and rarely fertilized.

The first harvest is taken 12 months after field planting by cutting the plant about 10-15 cm above ground level. Subsequently, 2 harvests are taken a year under rainfed conditions and 3 harvests may be possible with irrigation. Under rainfed conditions, dried-leaf yield in the 1st year may be about 200 kg/ha, while over the 2nd, 3rd and 4th years, yields normally range from 1000 to 1500 kg/ha. With irrigation, heavy fertilizer treatment and 3 croppings a year, peak yields in excess of 2000 kg/ha can be obtained. Maximum yields occur during the 1st 4-8 years after planting, but plants are often left in the field for 12-25 (max. 40) years. 

Henna removes a large quantity of nutrients from the soil: a yield of 1000 kg dry leaves removes 180-190 kg nitrogen, 100-150 kg potassium and 10-30 kg phosphates. 

For rainfed cultivation, the rainfall should be well distributed but with 2 dry periods a year to facilitate postharvest leaf drying. Leaves are dried in the shade to retain the green colour.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; long-term storage is feasible. On average, there are about 700 000 seeds/kg.
L. inermis is widely distributed throughout the Sahel and into Central Africa; it also occurs in the Middle East. It grows mainly along watercourses and in semi-arid regions and is adapted to a wide range of conditions. It can withstand low air humidity and drought. Henna requires high temperatures for germination, growth and development.
L. inermis is easy to propagate from cuttings; regeneration from seed is also possible but seeds are not always viable. Seeds are pretreated by steeping in water for 3-7 days with daily changing of the water; they are then placed in small heaps and kept moist and warm for a few days. The swollen, well-drained seeds, with a soft seed coat, are mixed with sand and a pinch of the mixture is put on top of the area to be planted. Germination takes place after 2-3 weeks, at a rate of 70%. Seedlings require 4-5 months in the nursery, at which time they will be about 40 cm tall; they are lifted, cut back to about 15 cm and transplanted into the field. Henna seedlings are hardy and can survive with little watering, but the planting site should be well prepared by ploughing, and manure or compost incorporated.
Erosion control: Trees are employed in soil conservation.
Fodder: Leaves of L. inermis are browsed by livestock.
Henna is a suitable source of firewood.
Fibre: In Turkana, Kenya, the stems are used for making fishing baskets.
Timber: The wood of henna is fine grained, hard, and is used to make tent pegs and tool handles in India.
Shade or shelter: L. inermis can be grown as a live fence.
Tannin or dyestuff: An orange-red dye is made by crushing the leaves and younger shoots to a grey-green powder. The powder is soaked in a mixture of strong tea and lemon juice and is used in Sudan, Middle Eastern countries and many Muslim communities in Africa for decorating hands, nails and feet with patterns. Henna is also used as a hair dye and conditioner as well as a colouring agent for leather and cloth. It may also be used to stain wood.
Medicine: Roots are regarded as a potent medicine for gonorrhoea and to enhance fertility in women; a decoction of them is considered to be diuretic or for treating blenorrhoea and pectoral for bronchitis. A reported constituent of the leaves is an oxynaphthoquinone called lawsone, which has antibiotic properties. Flower oil contains alpha- and beta-ionone, the latter being the main component. Leaf and flower infusions are applied externally for ulcers and rheumatism or are taken orally for tetanus, epilepsy and stomach pains; leaves are used in treatment of leprosy, jaundice and scurvy. Astringent roots are ground and rubbed on the heads of children to treat boils and eye diseases. In Malaysia, fresh bruised leaves are used as poultices to relieve a burning sensation of the feet; to treat beriberi, skin diseases, boils, circumcision wounds and distension of the stomach; a decoction can also be gargled to treat gum boils, or prescribed to relieve abdominal pains after childbirth. It is an emmenagogue and an abortifacient. In Indonesia, a paste of the leaves is applied for diseases of the fingernails and for herpes infection; tea made from the leaves is said to be taken to prevent obesity, and an ointment made from very young fruits treats itches. In the Philippines, flowers are reported to be soporific.
Ornamental: An attractive small tree that can be successfully grown in gardens."
Leucaena collinsii,"Local names:
 Spanish (guash,guaje,chalip)
Leucaena collinsii is a small to medium sized deciduous tree, 10-15 (-20) m tall, and 20-40 cm diameter at breast height. Bark grey brown with shallow rusty orange brown vertical fissures, slash cream white. Trees frequently grow with a pronounced lean and branches are sometimes planar.

Leaves consist of (5) 6-16 pairs of pinnae, pinacular rachis 4-9 cm long, leaflets 4-7 mm long, 1-2 mm wide, 25-56 pairs of pinna, asymmetric about mid vein, broadly linear. The petiole gland is yellow green or green, sessile, round or elliptic, dome-shaped or rounded with a narrow central pore, 2 by 1 mm.

Flower heads 9-24 mm in diameter, 55-170 pale cream-white flowers, in groups of 2-3(6) in leaf axils on actively growing shoots, the leaves developing with the flower heads, the flowering shoot indeterminate in growth with pods borne on older wood within crown.

Pods 11-18(-20) cm long, (7-)10-19 mm wide, 1 or 2(-4) per flower head, linear-oblong, acuminate, or sometimes obtuse apically, sometimes with a short beak, flat, 9-20 seeded, mid-brown, glabrous, opening along both sutures.

Two subspecies are recognized, ssp. collinsii, which occurs in Mexico and ssp. zacapana, restricted to Guatemala. Tree form varies greatly, ssp. collinsii generally has a wide, open crown and heavy branching while ssp. zacapana is very branchy when young with numerous small branches and a spreading crown.
Ecology

L. collinsii is a species of the seasonally dry tropical inland valleys of southern Mexico and Guatemala. It occurs in valleys with marked rain shadow and seasonally dry or semi-arid tropical, frost-free climate with a long dry season lasting for 6-7 months. The species is drought tolerant, and notably ssp. zacapana, extends in to dry thorn scrub and semi-arid areas, often forming dense thickets in secondary vegetation.
Native range
Guatemala, Mexico
Tree management

The tree’s coppice resprouts are numerous and are lopped for fodder; ssp. zacapana shows very good coppicing ability and is managed as a bush fallow on a 4-year coppice rotation.
There are 22 000-23 000 seeds/kg in ssp. collinsii and 30 000-36 000 seeds/kg in ssp. zacapana. Seed can be stored under conditions of <10 % moisture content at <4 deg. C for long periods while retaining high viability. Seed should be stored in hermetically sealed containers.

The species is drought tolerant, and notably ssp. zacapana, extends in to dry thorn scrub and semi-arid areas, often forming dense thickets in secondary vegetation.
The tree is a heavy seeder from an early age and poses risk of becoming a ruderal weed. Seed pretreatment is necessary before sowing, treatment depending on the age of the individual lot. Hot water treatment may be applied although the most reliable method is scarification.
  Trees of ssp. are cultivated for pod production. The unripe seeds are consumed locally and the pods marketed in regional markets in Guatemala and Mexico.
The leaves are readily consumed by stock and are highly digestible. Those of ssp. zacapana have highly nutritious leaves with low tannin content, high crude protein combined with low fibre.
The species is valued for high quality fuelwood.  spp. zacapana is particularly managed as a bush fallow on a 4-year rotation to produce high quality firewood.
Timber:  L. collinsii produces wood of high density and a high proportion of heartwood with mean wood density ranging between 0.75-0.91. It is very durable and therefore highly valued for poles and fence posts. Subspecies zacapana is extremely valued for its dense wood with abundant heartwood. Secondary stands are managed in parts of Guatemala on a four year coppice rotation specifically for fuelwood production.
Gum or resin:  The tree stem exudes a gum that is similar to gum arabic in properties.
Nitrogen fixing: The species is nitrogen fixing.
Trees of ssp. collinsii are planted at field boundaries and around houses as a living fence.
Soil improver: Lopped leaves and twigs are applied as green manure.
Intercropping: The tree is intercropped under taungya or whole rotation with fruit tree primarily as livestock feed and green manure. 
Other services:  L. collinsii is one of the most psyllid resistant leucaena species and it has been used in breeding programmes to improve resistance of other species."
Leucaena diversifolia,"Local names:
 English (wild tamarind,red leucaena,leucaena,diversifolia), Filipino (ipil-ipil), French (leucaena petit feuille), Indonesian (lamtoro), Spanish (guaje)
Leucaena diversifolia is a tree or erect shrub, 3-20 m tall, with a single-stemmed bole 20-50 cm in diameter, slender and clear up to 10 m in height, ascending branches with horizontal twigs. Bark on young branches smooth, rougher on bole, grey-brown with shallow rusty orange-brown vertical fissures; slash green then cream.

Leaves with (min. 14) 16-24 (max. 28) pairs pinnae; pinnular rachis (min. 3.5) 5-7 (max. 8) cm long, densely covered with white hairs; leaflets (min. 2.9) 4-5.5 (max. 7) mm long, (min. 0.6) 0.8-1 (max. 1.2) mm wide, (min. 43) 48-58 (max. 62) pairs per pinna, linear-oblong, acute at apex, strongly asymmetric at base, glabrous except for hairy margins.

Flower heads 11-15 mm in diameter, the buds loosely packed; 45-90 flowers per head, in groups of 1-5 (max. 7) in leaf axils, on actively growing indeterminate shoots, the leaves developing with flowers; stamen filaments, anthers and style white, pale pink, sometimes bright shocking pink, and occasionally bright scarlet; anthers sparsely hairy at the tip.

Pods 1-6 (max. 7) per flower head, (min. 7) 10-13 (max. 15.5) cm long, (min. 11) 13-16 (max. 17) mm wide, narrowly linear-oblong, flat 6-20-seeded, pod walls thin, papery dark brown or reddish-brown, sometimes lustrous, glabrous or covered in dense velvety hairs, opening along both sides. Seeds 4.3-5.5 mm wide, 2.7-3.4 mm long; the smallest of any species of Leucaena.

The specific name ‘diversifolia’ means ‘with leaves of different shapes on the same individual’; from the Latin ‘diversus’ (divergent) and ‘folium’ (leaf).
Ecology

The natural distribution of L. diversifolia corresponds to a narrow zone of moist or very moist submontane evergreen forest, subject to frequent mist and cloud cover. L. diversifolia also grows sometimes abundantly in secondary vegetation. As a mid-elevation species, it is tolerant of cool climates but not frost. In Hawaii, on cool mid-elevation sites, it outyields L. leucocephala, but it did not survive moderate frost in Florida. It thus grows well in cool, stable, frost-free climates that closely resemble conditions in the natural populations in Veracruz, Mexico. Rainfall and cloud cover are high in the natural range with 1500-3500 mm rainfall, a short dry season of 0-3 (max. 4) months and frequent mist.

L. diversifolia is a tropical highland species found in cool and seasonally wet locations. It does not withstand drought well and tolerates only partial shade. It is often grown in deforested degraded areas dominated by Imperata cylindrica and Themeda triandra.

L. diversifolia is selfing; it flowers and fruits over an extended season and sets prodigious quantities of seed from an early age. In other words, it has all the traits to make it an aggressive colonizer of ruderal sites and secondary or disturbed vegetation in many places.
Native range
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua
Tree management

The aggressive nature and profuse growth of L. diversifolia occasionally make it a weed; seedlings can be controlled effectively by spraying them with diesel oil at the 3-5 leaf stage. Established trees can be controlled by impregnating freshly cut stumps of a basal diameter of 1-20 cm with diesel oil. The treatment should be repeated on coppiced stumps. Delaying application until 1 day after cutting reduces its efficacy.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at room temperature with 5-8% mc. There are 60 000-80 000 seeds/kg.

L. diversifolia can be propagated through direct sowing. Seeds do not germinate unless scarified by scratching or cracking the tough, water-impervious seed coat. Vigorously boiling water poured over seeds, stirred gently and poured off in 3-5 minutes results in about 70% germination; alternatively, seeds can be soaked in water 80 deg. C for 3 minutes. Seeds may take a week to germinate. Typically, seedlings should be transplanted into the field 8-12 weeks after germination.

Vegetative propagation from cuttings and grafts has generally failed, although tissue culture is successful.
In reforestation schemes, it is planted for soil amelioration and stabilization.
Erosion control: Soil erosion can be controlled effectively by planting L. diversifolia. 
Fodder: L. diversifolia has lower palatability and digestibility and higher condensed tannin levels than L. leucocephala, indicating lower fodder quality. However, digestibility and tannin levels are intermediate compared with other Leucaena species. The mimosine content is low (1.5-2.5%). Rations for ruminants should not contain more than 50% L. diversifolia, and the proportion for non-ruminants should not exceed 10%.
One of the primary uses of the species is firewood and charcoal; its energy value is 900-19 300 kJ/kg.
Fibre: The pulp is desirable for paper production.
Timber: Sufficiently large logs are used in construction and as poles. The wood of L. diversifolia has a density of 400-500 kg/cubic m.
Shade or shelter: Its light crown makes L. diversifolia an ideal species for shade over perennial crops such as coffee, and this has been one of the main uses in Jamaica, Papua New Guinea and, where cultivated within its natural range, in Mexico and Guate
Gum or resin: L. diversifolia produces a water-soluble gum containing the sugar rhamnose.
Nitrogen fixing: The tree nodulates and fixes atmospheric nitrogen with Rhizobium strains that also nodulate with L. leucocephala. On soils very low in nitrogen, a moderate application of nitrogen fertilizer may increase nodulation and nitrogen fixation. A fertilizer application of 50-100 kg N/ha was found to increase the number of nodules per tree from 11.5 to 25-30, while nodule dry weight increased by 63-70%.
Soil improver: The annual leaf dry matter production can reach 10-16 t/ha. When incorporated as green manure, this adds 72-119 kg nitrogen, 2.5-3 kg phosphorus, 29-60 kg potassium, 47-94 kg calcium and 7.5-18.5 kg magnesium to the soil per ha. This is equivalent to about 10 t/ha cattle manure per year.
Intercropping: In agroforestry and mixed pastures, L. diversifolia is grown as an alternative for L. leucocephala, where the latter performs poorly because of high altitude or psyllid attack.
Other services: L. diversifolia is a promising parent in artificial hybridization and its hybrid with L. leucocephala, designated KX3 by the University of Hawaii, has proved to be fast growing with impressive tree."
Leucaena esculenta,"Local names:
 Spanish (guaje rojo,guaje colorado), Trade name (guaje rojo,guaje colorado)
Leucaena esculenta is a deciduous, small to medium-sized tree 10-15 m tall, 20-70 cm bole diameter, typically multi-stemmed and branchy when young, older trees with a short clear bole to 5 m, heavy spreading branches and an open spreading rounded crown. Bark thick, corky, pale silvery grey, with a metallic sheen like galvanized zinc, smooth, becoming horizontally gnarled; slash bright green then orange-red, shoots angular with 5-6 longitudinal corky ridges.

Leaves bipinnate, 30-40 pairs of pinnae, leaflets 3.5-6.6 mm long by 0.9-1 mm wide, 60-75 pairs per pinna, asymmetric, linear, acute or subacute, glabrous. Petiole gland large, maroon-red, sessile, elliptic, shallowly concave 5.5-8 by 3-4 mm.

Flower head 25-28 mm in diameter, 150-170 flowers per head, in groups of 2-7 at nodes on often one-branched terminal determinate shoots with complete or partial suppression of leaf development, flowers white.

Pods 15-25 cm long, 23-26 mm wide, 1-2 per flower head, oblong to oblong linear, flat, (few) 15-20 seeded, glossy reddish maroon unripe, turning mid orange-brown when ripe, glabrous, opening along both sides. Seed 9-11 mm long, 7-9 mm wide, circular to ovoid, aligned transversely in pods.

The specific epithet means edible.
Ecology

L. esculenta forms a canopy tree in mid-elevation seasonally dry deciduous tropical forest and at higher elevations in oak, oak-juniper and juniper forest. It can withstand up to seven months dry season and occasional light frost but it does not thrive above 2 000 m. Rainfall in its natural range is highly seasonal and the dry season lasts up to 7 months. Soils are mainly calcareous.
Native range
Mexico
Tree management

There are 3 forms of management of L. esculenta in its native range: cultivation, selective retention or tolerance of particular individuals in disturbed areas and gathering from purely wild populations. The tree is tolerant of annual lopping and is adaptable to a range of management regimes in agroforestry. Trees are heavily lopped each year during the dry season when pods are produced and resprout vigorously with the onset of rains. In addition, trees are frequently cut to produce livestock fodder. The tree’s rapid growth, moderate drought and cold tolerance, and high resistance to the psyllid attack indicate that L. esculenta has considerable untapped potential for wider planting.
There are around 8 700 seeds/kg. Seeds tend to harden with storage. Seed production, although abundant in its native range, can be very sparse under some climatic conditions, such as Hawaii and this may have limited its wider spread.

Rainfall in its natural range is highly seasonal and the dry season lasts up to 7 months. Soils are mainly calcareous.
The seeds are large, relatively soft and do not require pretreatment. They can be sown directly and will germinate rapidly giving a rapid initial growth. Results of experiments showed that untreated fresh seed gives up to 79 % of the expected germination with manual scarification.
  In the trees native region, the pods, seeds, and young leaves are gathered from wild populations. The immature pods, leaf and flower buds are edible. They are the traditional greens of the indigenous people of Mexico. They are gathered from June to September. Galls frequently develop on leaves and pods, these are consumed raw, roasted or boiled. Immature seeds are the products most consumed and are either eaten raw, roasted, milled and added to traditional sauces, or cooked in stews. Seeds are gathered in from November to February, when they are still immature. They may be consumed fresh or ground into a paste and sun dried for long term storage. They are also stored after being dried and salted.
In Mexico, trees are lopped for livestock fodder. Both leaves and unripe pods are consumed. However, low edible fraction, in vitro dry matter digestibility and high-condensed tannin levels limit its importance.
The tree provides high quality fuelwood.
Timber:  The wood of L. esculenta has an average density of (0.7), with slow early formation of heartwood. It is rarely used in Mexico because trees are protected for pod production. Non-seedy or seedless clones are attractive options for most of leucaena's wood uses, including fuelwood, pulpwood, roundwood, charcoal, parquet, and craftwood. 
Shade or shelter:  It is used as a shade tree especially for coffee.
Gum or resin: Analysis of several leucaena gums has revealed that they have the closest match to gum arabic of any gums tested from a hundred or so tropical trees. Although toxicity and related studies are needed, leucaena gum may have potential for use a
Nitrogen fixing:  The tree is nitrogen fixing.
Ornamental: Hybrids such as L. retusa x L. esculenta make attractive home ornamentals.
The tree is planted at field boundaries or as living fences.
Soil improver:  Lopped leaves and twigs can be applied as green manure.
Intercropping:  The species is widely incorporated in cropping systems with annual or fruit crops.
Other services: L. esculenta is highly resistant to the psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana), and it has been used in breeding programmes."
Leucaena leucocephala,"Local names:

Leucaena leucocephala is a small, variably shrubby and highly branched (ssp. leucocephala) to medium-sized tree with a short, clear bole to 5 m, upright angular branching and a narrow open crown (ssp. glabrata), 3-15 (max. 20) m tall, bole diameter 10-50 cm. Bark on young branches smooth, grey-brown, slash salmon pink, darker grey-brown and rougher with shallow, rusty orange-brown vertical fissures and deep red inner bark on older branches and bole. This evergreen plant is deep rooted. It often has a combination of flowers, immature and mature pods all present on the tree at the same time.

Leaves with (min. 4) 6-9 pairs pinnae; pinnular rachis 5-10.2 cm long, leaflets 9-16 (max. 21) mm long, 2-4.5 mm wide, 13-21 pairs per pinna, slightly asymmetric, linear-oblong to weakly elliptic, acute at tip, rounded to obtuse at base, glabrous except on margins. Leaves and leaflets fold up with heat, cold or lack of water.

Flower heads 12-21 mm in diameter, 100-180 flowers per head, in groups of 2-6 in leaf axils, arising on actively growing young shoots, flowers white or pale cream-white.

Pods (min. 9) 11-19 cm long, (min. 13) 15-21 mm wide, (min. 3) 5-20 (max. 45) per flower head, linear-oblong, acute or rounded at apex, flat, 8-18 seeded, mid- to orange-brown, glabrous and slightly lustrous or densely covered in white velvety hairs, papery, opening along both margins. Seeds hard, dark brown with a hard, shining testa, 6.7-9.6 mm long, 4-6.3 mm wide, aligned transversely in pod.

The specific name ‘leucocephala’ comes from ‘leu’, meaning white, and ‘cephala’, meaning head, referring to the flowers. There are 3 recognized subspecies: ssp. leucocephala, ssp. glabrata (Rose) S. Zárate, and ssp. ixtahuacana C. E. Hughes.
Ecology

L. leucocephala is essentially a tropical species requiring warm temperatures for optimum growth and with poor cold tolerance and significantly reduced growth during cool winter months in subtropical areas. For optimal growth it is therefore limited to areas 15-25 deg. north or south of the equator. L. leucocephala sheds its leaves even with light frosts, and heavy frost kills all above-ground growth, although trees often sprout the following summer. It grows well only in subhumid or humid climates with moderate dry seasons of up to 6-7 months. It thrives under irrigation regimes similar to those applied to maize (i.e. over 1200 mm/year). L. leucocephala tolerates fast fires and can regrow after being burned to the crown by slower fires.

L. leucocephala ssp. leucocephala is an aggressive colonizer of ruderal sites and secondary or disturbed vegetation in many places, both in Mexico and in many parts of Asia such as the Philippines. This has been attributed to its precocious year-round flowering and fruiting, abundant seed production, self-fertility, hard seed coat, and ability to resprout after fire or cutting. It is now naturalized and among the most prevalent invasive species in many areas such as open (often coastal) habitats, semi-natural, disturbed, degraded habitats, other ruderal sites, and occasionally, agricultural land where it has been planted as a shade tree over cacao. It is a serious problem in Tonga.
Native range
Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, United States of America
Tree management

L. leucocephala is a vigorous coppicer and responds well to pollarding and pruning. Coppiced stems sprout 5-15 branches, depending on the diameter of the cut surface, and 1-4 stems dominate after a year of regrowth. Wood yields from L. leucocephala over short (3-5 year) rotations compare favourably with other species, ranging from 3-4 m in height/year and 10-60 cubic m/ha a year. On less favourable sites, as in cooler tropical highland areas, on acid soils, or under high psyllid pressure, yields have often been disappointing, and under such conditions other species of Leucaena or other genera generally outperform L. leucocephala. 

High plant densities are recommended for solid fodder. Fodder yields range from 40 to 80 t/ha when moisture is not limiting.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability can be maintained for 20 years in open storage at room temperature; seeds germinate after 99 years in a herbarium; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at room temperature with 5-8% mc. There are 15 000-20 000 seeds/kg.

It is a serious problem in Tonga.
Seedlings and direct sowing are recommended methods of propagation where soil-moisture conditions permit and economic weed control can be maintained. Seed pretreatment involves soaking in hot water for 2 minutes or nicking the seed coat at the distal (cotyledon) end, using a sharp tool like scalpel, knife or nail clipper. A germination rate of 50-80% in 8 days can be achieved. The species can thrive under irrigation regimes similar to those of maize.

Vegetative propagation has been successful in relatively few locations, reflecting critical environmental requirements, or possibly systemic fungi. The use of bare-root cuttings has worked in Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand.
L. leucocephala thrives on steep slopes and in marginal areas with extended dry seasons, making it a prime candidate for restoring forest cover, watersheds and grasslands.
Erosion control: An aggressive taproot system helps break up compacted subsoil layers, improving the penetration of moisture into the soil and decreasing surface runoff.
 Pods, seeds and leaf tips have been used as food, although mimosine toxicity makes this practice risky. In Indonesia, a food called ‘tempe lamtoro’ is made of fermented leucaena seeds. Seeds can also be prepared as a coffee substitute.
Fodder: L. leucocephala is one the highest quality and most palatable fodder trees of the tropics, often being described as the ‘alfalfa of the tropics’. The leaf quality compares favourably with alfalfa or lucerne in feed value except for its higher tannin content and mimosine toxicity to non-ruminants. Livestock feed should not contain more than 20% of L. leucocephala, as the mimosine can cause hair loss and stomach problems. Leaves have a high nutritive value (high palatability, digestibility, intake and crude-protein content), resulting in 70-100% increase in animal live weight gain compared with feeding on pure grass pasture. Herbage taken at peak quality has 55-70% digestibility and 20-25% crude protein. In addition, it is very persistent over several decades of cutting or grazing, is highly productive, recovers quickly from defoliation, combines well with companion grasses and can be grazed with minimal losses from trampling or grazing. Forage, packed in pellets and cubes, is internationally marketed as animal feed. 
Apiculture: L. leucocephala is in bloom almost throughout the year, providing constant forage to honey bees.
L. leucocephala is an excellent firewood species with a specific gravity of 0.45-0.55 and a high calorific value of 4600 cal/kg. Wood burns steadily with little smoke, few sparks and produces less than 1% ash. The tree makes excellent charcoal with a heating value of 29 mJ/kg and good recovery values (25-30%). Addition of ground L. leucocephala to fuel oil for diesel engines was found to involve no harmful agents in the ash.
Fibre: Fibre values are similar to those of other tropical hardwoods, and it produces paper with good printability but low tearing and folding strength; the wood-pulp strength is greater than that of most hardwoods, with almost 50% greater ring crush. Its pulping properties are suitable for both paper and rayon production. Also used for particleboard production.
Timber: L. leucocephala has hard heavy wood (about 800 kg/m), with a pale yellow sapwood and light reddish-brown heartwood. The wood is known to be of medium density and to dry without splitting or checking. It is strong, medium textured, close grained and easily workable for a wide variety of carpentry purposes. Sawn timber, mine props, furniture and parquet flooring are among increasingly popular uses. However, the use of L. leucocephala for sawn timber is greatly limited by its generally small dimensions (usually not greater than 30 cm diameter), its branchiness, which limits lengths of clear bole available and means wood is often knotty, and its high proportion of juvenile wood. Nevertheless, there is growing use of small-dimension sawn wood in a number of industries such as flooring, which might include L. leucocephala in the future. Poles are used to prop bananas and as a support for yams, pepper and other vines. Use of short-rotation L. leucocephala for poles is limited by their lack of durability and susceptibility to attack by termites and woodborers.
Shade or shelter: L. leucocephala is used as a shade tree for cocoa, coffee and tea; it generally acts as a shelterbelt, providing shade and wind protection for a variety of crops, especially during early growth. 
Tannin or dyestuff: Red, brown and black dyes are extracted from the pods, leaves and bark.
Gum or resin: Gum arises from Leucaena stems under ill-defined conditions of injury and disease or from sterile hybrids, especially L. leucocephala x L. esculenta. The gum has been analysed and found similar to gum arabic and of potential commercial value
Nitrogen fixing: It has high nitrogen-fixing potential (100-300 kg N/ha a year), related to its abundant root nodulation.
Ornamental: Suitable as an ornamental and roadside landscaping species.
Used as a live fence, firebreak and live support for vines such as pepper, coffee and cocoa, vanilla, yam and passion fruit.
Soil improver: L. leucocephala was one of the 1st species to be used for the production of green manure in alley-cropping systems. Leaves of L. leucocephala, even with moderate yields, contain more than enough nitrogen to sustain a maize crop. The finely divided leaves decompose quickly, providing a rapid, short-term influx of nutrients. It has even been suggested that the leaves decompose too rapidly, resulting in leaching of nutrients away from the crop-rooting zone before they are taken up by the crop. This also means that they have little value as mulch for weed control. The tree has the potential to renew soil fertility and could be particularly important in slash-and-burn cultivation, as it greatly reduces the fallow period between crops. 
Intercropping: Leucaena is one of the most widely used species in alley cropping, where it is planted in hedges along contours at intervals of 3-10 m with crops in between.
Other services: The dried seeds are widely used for ornamentation."
Leucaena pallida,"Local names:
 Spanish (guaje delgado)
Leucaena pallida is a small deciduous multiple-stemmed tree 3-7 m tall although occasionally to 10 m tall and a bole diameter of 10-15 (-30) cm, with an open, spreading or narrow crown. Bark smooth, metallic-grey, blotched lighter grey with horizontally aligned pale brown lenticels, slash greenish.

Leaves have 15-27 pairs of pinnae, pinnular rachis 8-11 cm long, sparsely hairy, leaflets 6-8(-10) mm long, 1-2 mm wide, 39-50 pairs per pinna, asymmetric truncate at base, linear or oblong, acuminate at apex. Petiole gland unstalked, shallow crater-shaped, elliptical, 3-4 mm long by 2-3 mm wide.

Flower head 14-16 mm in diameter, 95-110 flowers per head, in groups of 3-5 in leaf axils on actively growing shoots, sometimes with suppression of leaves on the flowering shoot, flowers appear pale pink or dull purplish mauve.

Pods 12-19 cm long, 14-18 mm wide, 3-5 per flower head, linear, slightly thickened and leathery, glossy maroon when unripe, turning reddish-brown, glabrous or occasionally hairy. Seed 5-7 mm wide, 6-8 mm long, slightly rhombic aligned transversely in pods.

The specific epithet means pale in reference to the flowers.
Ecology

It is mainly found in the mid interior highlands of south central Mexico on shallow calcareous soils, in disturbed dry thorn forest, dry mattoral, oak forest, oak-pine forest and particularly in the oak-dry thorn forest transition zone. It is moderately frost tolerant and withstands 5-7 months dry season in its native range where rainfall is highly seasonal.
Native range
Mexico
Tree management

The tree coppices well producing few seeds. Silvicultural practice should include dense planting (10 000 stems/ha) with thinning for fuelwood at one and three years, and harvest after 6-8 years. Trees are lopped annually during pod harvesting.
There are between 20 000-25 000 seeds/kg. Seeds can be stored for a long time if stored at <=4 deg. C and <10 % moisture content following conventional seed storage methods.
It is mainly found in the mid interior highlands of south central Mexico on shallow calcareous soils, in disturbed dry thorn forest, dry mattoral, oak forest, oak-pine forest and particularly in the oak-dry thorn forest transition zone. It is moderately frost tolerant and withstands 5-7 months dry season in its native range where rainfall is highly seasonal.
L. pallida is mainly propagated by seed. Seeds require pretreatment to break the hard seed coat and the most reliable method is manual scarification. A second method of producing seedless leucaena exploits the self-incompatibility characteristic of all diploid species and of L. pallida. A self incompatible species would be cloned and used.
  L. pallida is extensively cultivated for its edible pods and seeds. It is valued because it produces unripe pods earlier than L. esculenta, therefore extending the overall production period. Unripe pods, seeds and flower head buds are harvested and consumed locally as well as being transported to local and regional markets.
L. pallida is replacing L. leucocephala in forage production. Its hybrid with the latter is especially valued for its exceptional forage yields, psyllid resistance and its spreading branchy habit is ideal for forage production. However, the nutritive value of the species and the hybrid are doubtful due to their lower edible fraction, higher condensed tannin content and lower digestibility than L. leucocephala. Psyllid resistance of hybrids like L. leucocephala x L. pallida, however, exceeds that of any L. leucocephala, permitting higher fodder yields under psyllid attack and the short heavily forked trees are preferred for herbivore browsing. Most accessions of the tetraploid species L. pallida are low forking and they confer this trait to some of their hybrids with L. leucocephala, some low shrubby dwarfs also result.
L. pallida is used widely for firewood.
Timber: The hybrid L. diversifolia x L. pallida is psyllid resistant and grows as a pseudo-shrub with many long straight branches. Poles are commonly used in the production of vine crops (black pepper, passion fruit, pole beans) where long, straight, thin poles are preferred.
Nitrogen fixing: L. pallida is nitrogen fixing.
L. pallida is largely cultivated on terrace margins or field boundaries.
Soil improver:  Lopped leaves and twigs can be applied as green manure.
Intercropping: Farmers in dry zones use L. pallida over crops as a tree fodder and in hedgerow agroforestry systems."
Leucaena salvadorensis,"Local names:
 Spanish (sipria,sipia,frijolillo,aserillo)
Leucaena salvadorensis forms a small- to medium-sized thornless tree, 10-15 m tall with a dbh of 20-50 cm. Occasionally, mature trees can reach 20 m in height and 70-100 cm in diameter. Trees are typically branchy when young but may have a short, clear bole to 5 m in height when older. The upright angular branches form a narrow, open crown. Bark on young trees is smooth, mid-metallic grey or grey-brown; inner bark salmon pink, becoming darker grey-brown, rougher with shallower vertical fissures with age; the inner bark becomes deep red.

Leaves bipinnate, 20-25 cm long and 19-26 cm wide with a short petiole 19-25 cm long; strongly discolorous; a mid-green or orange gland, 5 mm long and 2.5 mm wide, below the basal pair of pinnae. Small glands occur at the base of the leaf rachis. There are 4-7 pairs of pinnae per leaf and 23-27 pairs of leaflets per pinna. The leaflets are 15-19 mm long and 3-4 mm wide with asymmetric venation. 

Flowers occur in white globose heads arising in the developing leaf axils. Individual flowers small and subtended by the small peltate bracts. The only visible flower parts are the stamen filaments, anthers and white styles. Typically, the styles extend beyond the anthers, giving the flower heads a stellar appearance. The hidden calyx is pale greenish-cream, tinged yellow on the lobe tips and 3-3.5 mm long. The corolla has 5 glabrous, pale yellow-green petals, 4-5 mm long, free to the base; the ovary with 16 ovules is 2 mm long, reddish and covered with whitish hairs around the upper end. 

Pod sturdier and more leathery than those of other Leucaena pods when ripe, greenish or reddish-green when immature, turning mid-chestnut brown when ripe and dehiscing along both margins. Typically, there are only 1-2 pods per flower head, borne on stout woody stipes 7-10 mm long. Pods 15-18 cm long and 27-30 mm wide with a slightly thickened margin, 10-15 seeds per pod. The seeds are large (8-12 mm x 5-6 mm), compressed, chestnut brown and glossy with a visible pleurogram.

The specific epithet means of El Salvadore.
Ecology

The species occupies a clearly defined, largely contiguous, distribution area. It has been found almost exclusively on the southern slopes of the hills of the Pacific watershed and is rarely, if ever, on the flat coastal plains. It is also notable that the distribution rarely overlaps with other Leucaena species. In El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, it occurs in the seasonally dry, tropical forest formations that extend throughout the Pacific coastal zone of Central America and Mexico. Trees normally found in association with L. salvadorensis include Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Gliricidia sepium, Senna atomaria and Myrospermum frutescens.
Native range
El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, United States of America
Tree management

In the seasonally dry areas like Central America, L. salvadorensis should be planted at the beginning of the rains in early June at a spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m to 1 x 3 m. If the species is to be used in alley cropping or soil-conservation barriers, the spacing should be reduced to 10-15 cm. The rows are then thinned and lopped as necessary. Further research is needed to define optimal silvicultural regimes. In many parts of the range where natural regeneration is protected, farmers actively manage trees by regularly pruning branches to produce a single stem for posts.
Seeds can be stored under conventional conditions of low mc (7-8%) and temperature (4 deg. C). Germination percentages of 70-80% are readily obtained for fresh seedlots, and there is no significant reduction in seed viability after 5 years of cold storage. The seeds of L. salvadorensis are large; there are 10 000-15 000 seeds/kg.

Trees normally found in association with L. salvadorensis include Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Gliricidia sepium, Senna atomaria and Myrospermum frutescens.
L. salvadorensis is a shy seeder. It can be established by direct sowing, which has rarely been successful unless sowing has taken place during good climatic conditions for germination and the seedlings have been protected from grazing and kept free of well weeds. Seed extraction and cleaning are by standard methods of manual threshing, winnowing and sieving. No pretreatment is required. The most common method of raising L. salvadorensis is to nurture natural regeneration and to protect seedlings and coppice shoots from fire and grazing animals.
Erosion control: In Nicaragua and Honduras, L. salvadorensis is used in soil-conservation programmes, where it is planted as a soil-conservation barrier.
Fodder: Natural regeneration is browsed by cattle, and the tree may have fodder potential, but there is little detailed knowledge about its fodder quality.
Apiculture: The sweetly scented flowers attract a large number of several species of small bees, an indication that it is an important honey source.
The wood is an excellent fuelwood because it is dense and is easily split and dried.
Timber: It is believed that reported straight, single-stemmed provenances may be the result of active manipulation by farmers. The poles are used in traditional houses as large-diameter corner posts and in roof construction. The wood is reputedly resistant to decay and durable in the ground; according to local residents, corner posts last 10-20 years.
Intercropping: The traditional retention by farmers of L. salvadorensis in fields in parts of its natural range indicates the agroforestry potential of the species. In several areas in Nicaragua, it was used in a series of alley-cropping trials and has been intercropped with corn, sorghum and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)."
Leucaena trichandra,"Local names:
 Spanish (guaje rojo,guaje flojo,guaje chiquito)
Leucaena trichandra is extremely variable in size and habit varying from a small slender shrub of 2 m height to a medium-sized tree to 20 m height and 50 cm bole diameter. Tree form is also very variable, usually slender with a clear bole up to 3 m height and a light feathery but spreading and irregular crown often modified by lopping. Bark on young branches smooth, rougher on bole, grey-brown to blackish-brown with shallow rusty orange-brown vertical fissures.

There are 11-20 pairs of pinnae, pinnular rachis 4-6 cm long; leaflets 4-7 mm long, 1-2 mm wide, 30-40 pairs per pinna, linear-oblong, acute at tip, and strongly asymmetric at base. Petiole gland one, or rarely a pair of adjacent glands, unstalked, strongly and deeply cup or crater shaped, round, 1.6-3.4 mm long by 1-1.7 mm wide and 1-2 mm tall, with an additional 1-2 glands at the base of terminal and sub-terminal pairs of pinnae and, where many, at the base of all pairs of pinnae.

Flower head 7-10 mm in diameter, 70-130 flowers per head, heads in groups of 3-5 in leaf axils, on actively growing indeterminate shoots; colour variable: stamen filaments white, sometimes tinged pink; anthers very hairy, pale cream-white, pinkish-grey, rose pink or violet, style white, tinged pink or scarlet.

Pods 7-11 cm long, 13-23 mm wide, 2-4 per flower head, narrowly or broadly linear-oblong, flat papery, yellow-green or reddish-green often deep maroon and very glossy unripe, becoming pale yellow or deep reddish-brown when ripe, sometimes lustrous, glabrous or covered in dense velvety hairs, opening along both sides.

Seeds 3-4 mm wide, 5-7 mm long aligned transversely in pods.

The specific name trichandra is derived from the Greek words trich- (hairy) and andrus (male) in reference to the anthers.
Ecology

L. trichandra occurs primarily as a small understorey or lower canopy tree or shrub in pine and oak forests at mid elevations. It also extends at lower altitudes into dry deciduous forest, dry mattoral and dry secondary forest. The species does not tolerate frost, but grows in a wide range of soils from shallow calcareous over limestone to shallow infertile more acidic soils. It occurs in mixture with other species of Leucaena including L. esculenta and L. pallida.
Native range
Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua
Tree management

The tree resprouts readily, even from large stumps after cutting and is amenable to regular lopping.
There are 40 000-70 000 seeds/kg.

It occurs in mixture with other species of Leucaena including L. esculenta and L. pallida.
Direct seeding is the most common method of propagation as with all Leucaena species. Seeds require pretreatment, poor germination (8 %) was obtained with 100 deg. C hot water, as it causes significant seed mortality. Recommended pretreatment include soaking in hot water (60-80 deg C) for 24 hrs or in cold water for 48 hrs. Manual scarification (nipping the distal end of the seed) has also been recommended. Seedlings are transplanted to the field 8-12 weeks after germination, which takes up to a week when they should be 15-30 cm tall.
  The unripe pods, seeds and flower buds are eaten in parts of southern Mexico; mature seeds are harvested and occasionally marketed from July to September.
As for other traits, fodder quality varies greatly with seed source, for instance condensed tannin content varies from very low to very high across different seed sources.
The wood is valued for firewood, which is rated as good quality and easy to split.
Timber:  Trees are used as a source of high quality poles and corner posts for house construction. The wood density varies with seed source. Wood from superior seed sources have average mean density of 0.7 and moderately high proportions of durable heartwood that forms rapidly.
Shade or shelter: It is used as a shade tree especially for coffee.
Nitrogen fixing: L. trichandra is nitrogen fixing.
The tree is commonly found scattered in fields and fencelines.
Soil improver:  Lopped leaves and twigs can be applied as green manure.
Intercropping: The species is incorporated in traditional indigenous agroforestry systems in its native range."
Liquidambar styraciflua,"Local names:
 Dutch (amberboom), English (sweet gum,hazel wood,red gum,yellow gum,hazel pine,alligator tree,satin walnut,blade gum,sycamore gum,bilstead,American red gum,starleaf gum), Spanish (ingamo,ien-gau-o,icob,kamaliso,estoraque,ko’ma,copalome,occob,copalme,copa
Liquidambar styraciflua is a medium to large deciduous tree, capable of attaining heights of more than 50 m, and from 1.5 to 4.5 m in diameter, with a straight bole. Bark on the main trunk is furrowed and greyish, and may be over 1 cm thick on old trees; younger branches red-brown, often with corky ridges or thick wings.

Leaves simple, 3-5 lobed, lobes triangular with a serrated margin, spirally arranged; laminae much broader than long, 4-11 x 5-15 cm, apex generally broadly acuminate, the base of the leaf truncated or weakly cordate, opaque dark green on the upper surface and light green beneath, changing to reddish or yellow when old and becoming glabrous; nervation palmate and prominent on the under surface with a bunch of hairs in the nerve axils. Leaves have an agreeable resinous smell when crushed. Petioles 1.5-9 cm long, greyish-brown and glabrous; young leaves bright green and soft.

Buds up to 1.5 cm long covered in acute or obtuse, brown, glabrous, shining scales; margin ciliolate; stipules 2, approximately 5 mm long, lanceolate, glabrous and caducous. A monoecious species: flowers borne in terminal or axillary panicles on short, lateral, woody, pubescent branchlets, 5-10 cm long. Male flowers on the upper part of the panicle, each bundle of flowers on a short branchlet 2-20 mm long, subtended by 1 or several ovate papery caducous ciliolate bracts; perianth absent; stamens numerous. Female flowers in small heads, 6-8 mm in diameter, held on a short stalk up to 1 cm long; regular, subtended by bracts similar to those in male flowers; perianth very short with 4-6 acute or truncate fleshy, papillose lobes; stamens absent; ovary semi-inferior with 2 partially free carpels.

Fruits grouped in small heads, 2.5-4 cm in diameter, on pendulous glabrous peduncles, 5-6.5 cm long; heads globose, spiky, woody, brown or shiny black, bivalved capsules, dehiscing at the apex, containing many brown, winged seeds 6-8 mm long.

The generic name is from the Latin ‘liquidus’ (liquid) and the Arabic ‘ambar’ (amber), because of the plant’s secretion of an aromatic fluid.
Ecology

Throughout its native range in North and Middle America, L. stryraciflua is often found in mixed or ‘transition’ forest, mainly associated with pine or oak. Trees loose their leaves completely between November and March-April in temperate regions, and this deciduous habit is maintained throughout the tropical part of the species’ natural range, although the leafless period may be reduced to 1 month. L. styraciflua occurs widely in the southeastern states of the USA (Alabama, Carolinas, Georgia, Maryland) extending as far as Connecticut, westwards to Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma and southwards to central Florida.

Trees are able to withstand a drought of up to 6 months. On account of its broad distribution range, there are marked differences in the frost tolerance of different provenances of the species. The northernmost populations (Connecticut) regularly experience minimum temperatures of the order of -24 deg. C, and those in Florida, -7 deg. C. The Mexican and Central American populations probably never experience frost, and it seems unlikely that they would show any degree of tolerance to it.
Native range
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, United States of America
Tree management

L. styraciflua has been managed extensively both in natural stands and in plantations in the USA, so a wealth of information is available on its silviculture. Field establishment is straightforward, benefiting from effective weed control. Planting of nursery-grown mycorrhizal sweet gum seedlings in sites may improve stand establishment and permit better utilization of fertilizers and other soil resources. The species coppices readily.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox with no loss in viability during 9 years of hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 5-10% mc; initial viability was maintained for at least 4 years in hermetic storage at 4 deg. C with 10-15% mc; seeds tolerate desiccation to 3.2% mc, no loss in viability occurs after 10 years of hermetic storage at -18 deg. C with 3.2-13.6% mc; 30% viability lost at 10 deg. C with 8.4% mc; considerable loss (80%) at 4 deg. C with 3.2% and 8.4% mc; and complete loss at 4 deg. C or 10 deg. C with 13.6 mc. There are about 178 600 seeds/kg.

The species regenerates by root sprouts. No pretreatment is necessary for the tropical provenances, but seeds from American sources require moist stratification of 15-90 days to achieve acceptable rates of germination.
Erosion control: L. styraciflua has potential for use in revegetating disturbed areas.
Fibre: Pulp and particleboard are obtainable from yellow gum.
Timber: The heartwood is a distinctive dark brown, sometimes beautifully figured with deep markings. Wood is hard, dense, bright red-brown; in the USA it is widely used by the furniture and cabinet making industries. Other major uses include boxes, crates, pallets and plywood.
Medicine: A balsamic exudate obtained from the sap of trees is used in the pharmaceutical industry.
Soil improver: Leaf decay improves soil by increasing the activity of soil microflora and building up the humus layer."
Litchi chinensis,"Local names:
 Bengali (lichi), Chinese (lizi,jingli,huoshan,danli), English (lychee nut,litchi,lychee), French (quenèpe chinois,quenepier chinois,litchi de chine,litchi,cerisier de la Chine), German (Chinesische Haselnuß,litchipflaume), Hindi (lici,licy,lichi), Indone
Litchi chinensis is a handsome, dense, round-topped tree with a smooth, grey, trunk and limbs. Under ideal conditions it may reach 12 m high, but is usually much smaller.

Leaves leathery, pinnate, divided into 4-8 pairs of elliptic or lanceolate, acuminate, glabrous leaflets, 5-7 cm long, reddish when young, becoming shiny and bright green.

Inflorescence a many-branched panicle, 5-30 cm long, many flowered; flowers small, yellowish-white, functionally male or female; calyx tetramerous; corolla absent. 

Fruit covered by a rough leathery rind or pericarp, pink to strawberry red. Fruit oval, heart shaped or nearly round, 2.5 cm or more in diameter. The edible portion or aril is white, translucent, firm and juicy. Flavour sweet, fragrant and delicious. Inside the aril is a seed that varies considerably in size. The most desirable varieties contain atrophied seeds called ‘chicken tongue’. These are very small, up to 1 cm in length. Larger seeds vary between 1 and 2 cm in length and are plumper than the chicken tongues. There is also a distinction between the lychee that leaks juice when the skin is broken and the ‘dry and clean’ varieties that are more desirable.

The specific name, ‘chinensis’, is Latin for ‘Chinese’.
Ecology

L. chinensis is one of the most environmentally sensitive of the tropical tree crops. It is adapted to the tropics and warm subtropics, producing best in regions with winters that are short, dry and cool but frost free, and summers that are long and hot with high rainfall. Good protection from wind is essential for cropping. Year-to-year variations in weather precipitate crop failures, for example, through untimely rain promoting flushing at the expense of floral development, or through poor fruit set following damp weather during bloom.
Native range
China, Malaysia, Vietnam
Tree management

L. chinensis needs full sun, but young trees must be protected from heat, frost and high winds. The trees need warmth and a frost-free environment but can often withstand light freezes with some kind of overhead protection. When plants are young, shelter can be provided by building a frame around them and covering it with straw or plastic sheeting. Electric light bulbs can also be used for added warmth.

The trees will not tolerate standing water but require very moist soil, so they should be watered regularly when growing actively. The trees are very sensitive to damage from salts in the soil or in water. The soil should be leached regularly in saline soil areas. Chelated iron and sulphur may be necessary in areas with alkaline soils. Young trees should receive only light applications of a complete fertilizer. Mature trees are heavier feeders and should be fertilized regularly.

Cincturing has been used commercially in China, Thailand, Australia, Florida and Hawaii to impose shoot rest and improve flowering and fruiting. Trees are cinctured after completion of the postharvest flush, if they are healthy and flushed actively. Young trees are pruned to establish a strong, permanent structure for easy harvest. After that, removing crossing or damaged branches is all that is necessary, although the trees can be pruned more heavily to control size; V-shaped crotches should be avoided because of the wood’s brittle nature.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant; storing seed in moist peat moss at 8 deg. C is recommended. Viability is reduced from 100% to less than 20% on desiccation to about 20% mc, and no seeds remain viable when mc is reduced below this value. There is complete loss in viability after 7 days of open storage at 30 deg. C; however, viability of seed stored moist at 5 deg. C was maintained for 60 and at 30 deg. C for 100 days. Germination rate was 92% after 7 weeks of moist storage at 8-10 deg. C with 100% rh and with 80% nitrous oxide plus 20% oxygen; 69% after 280 days moist storage at 15 deg. C in moist (20% mc) perlite, plus chlorthalonil. Excised embryonic axes tolerate desiccation to 30% mc. Seeds extracted from fruit harvested at 98 days after anthesis are more tolerant of desiccation than those from overripe or immature fruit.
L. chinensis is one of the most environmentally sensitive of the tropical tree crops. It is adapted to the tropics and warm subtropics, producing best in regions with winters that are short, dry and cool but frost free, and summers that are long and hot with high rainfall. Good protection from wind is essential for cropping. Year-to-year variations in weather precipitate crop failures, for example, through untimely rain promoting flushing at the expense of floral development, or through poor fruit set following damp weather during bloom.
Air-layering is the most common method of propagation, and rates of success are usually not less than 95%. Other methods of propagation include grafting (useful for top-working older trees), budding and use of cuttings (for the rapid multiplication of new cultivars). Incompatibility occurs in some scion and root-stock combinations. Wedge and bud grafts are possible, but seldom used.

Growing L. chinensis from seed needs care and promptness, because seeds soon lose their viability if permitted to dry after removal from the fruit. The seeds germinate without pretreatment when sown fresh. Young seedlings grow vigorously until they reach 24-30 cm.
 The juicy aril is the edible part of the lychee. It may be eaten fresh or juiced, preserved in syrup and canned, dried or frozen. Lychee nuts are fruit that has been dried, either artificially or in the sun. The food value of lychee lies in its sugar content, which ranges from 7 to 21%, depending on climate and cultivar. Fruit also contains about 0.7% protein, 0.3% fat, 0.7% minerals (particularly calcium and phosphorus) and is a reasonable source of vitamins C (64 mg/100 g pulp), A, B1 and B2. The strong appeal of lychee lies in the exquisite aroma of the fruit.
Apiculture: This tree is widely grown for instance in Singapore and Mauritius as a major honey source. The honey is of excellent quality and flavour.
Timber: The wood is said to be nearly indestructible, although it is brittle and has few uses.
Tannin or dyestuff: Bark contains tannin.
Medicine: The fruit, its peel and the seed are used in traditional medicine; decoctions of the root, bark and flowers are used as a gargle. Seeds are used as an anodyne in neuralgic disorders and orchitis.
Ornamental: L. chinensis trees are beautiful in spring, when they are covered with huge sprays of flowers; they are also an attractive sight when in full fruit. These characteristics make it a popular ornamental tree in parks and gardens.
Alcohol: Lychee fruit can be processed into wine."

Brown mahogany is propagated mainly by seedlings and wildings.
Erosion control:  This species is important in water catchment area protection.
The tree provides fuelwood.
Timber:  The tree produces a beautiful dark brownish red timber, is cross-grained and difficult to work. The timber is generally marketed with L. trichiloides. In Zimbabawe it was formerly used for outdoor work.
Shade or shelter:  The brown mahogany provides cool shading.
Intercropping:  Because of the height of the tree, it  is very suitable for intercropping as  shade is cast over a large area and will not suppress the near crops or trees. It is therefore planted in pure stands or intercropped in banana, coffee and cacao plantations."
Lovoa trichilioides,"Local names:
 English (Uganda walnut,tiger wood,Nigerian golden walnut,lovoa,Congo wood,African walnut), Luganda (nkoba), Trade name (African walnut)
Lovoa trichilioides is a large forest tree, up to 40 m high with a dark heavy crown. The bole is cylindrical and the first branches appear at 18-25 m. Butresses usually absent. The bark is greyish on younger trees, but brownish, thin and scaly on older trees. The slash is reddish, cedar scented and produces a little sticky sap.

Leaves compound pinnate, alternately placed, with 4-6 pairs of leaflets. The petiole is flat above and narrowly winged.

Flowers small and numerous, greenish-white to white, growing in large lax panicles up to 30 cm long, some terminal. Each flower 4-part with a staminal tube resembling that of Entandophragma.

Fruit black, spindle shaped and in bunches, open with 4 valves to release the 4-8 winged seeds. Each seed winged attaching it to the base of the fruit. The generic name Lovoa is after River Lovoi in Congo. The generic name 'trichilioides' implies its semblance to members of the genus Trichilia.
Ecology

L. trichilioides, the only West African species of this genus is a monoecious evergreen forest emergent. But also occurs in thickets, gallery forest, mixed tropical forests and is extremely common in lake side forests in Uganda.

Macadamia integrifolia,"Local names:
 English (smooth macadamia nut,Queensland nut,macadamia nut,Australian bush nut)
Macadamia integrifolia is a large, spreading, evergreen tree attaining a height of 18 m and a crown of 15 m.

Leaves in whorls of 3, oblong to oblanceolate, 10-30 x 2-4 cm, glabrous, coriaceous, irregularly spiny-dentate when young, entire in later stages; petiole 5-15 mm long; 3 buds arranged longitudinally in the axil of each leaf usually only the top bud shoots out, making a sharply acute angle with the trunk. 

Racemes axillary on mature new growth or on leafless older shoot, pendulous, 10-30 cm long, with 100-500 flowers; flowers in groups of 2-4, about 12 mm long, creamy-white; pedicles 3-4 mm long; perianth tubular with 4 petaloid sepals.

Fruit a globose follicle, 2.5-4 cm in diameter; pericarp fibrous, about 3 mm thick. Seed (nut) usually 1, globular, with a smooth, hard, thick (2-5 mm) testa enclosing the edible kernel.

The genus is named after J. Macadam (1827-1865), secretary of the philosophical Institute of Victoria. The specific name integrifolia is from the Latin integri-‘entire’ and folium-‘a leaf’ in allusion to the grouping of leaves in whorls of four.
Ecology

M. integrifolia prefers well-drained soils, shelter from winds and a mild, frost-free, subtropical climate with well-distributed annual rainfall of at least 1 200 mm. It occurs naturally in the fringes of subtropical rainforests. It appears to tolerate only a narrow range of temperatures (optimum during the growing season is 25 deg. C). Temperature is the major climatic variable determining growth and productivity. Trees in Southeast Asia grow fairly well but flower and fruit sporadically throughout the year. In eastern Africa, orchards are planted at elevations of 1 000-1 600 m in areas with a prominently seasonal climate, leading to a synchronous resumption of growth and flowering over a cool, overcast season. Abnormal tree growth, low yield and poor nut quality have been noted in Africa at higher altitudes with little sunshine during the flowering and fruiting season.

The xerophytic characteristics of the tree, including the sclerophyllous leaves and proteoid roots (dense clusters of rootlets formed to explore poor soils low in phosphorus) suggest adaptation to relatively harsh environments. However, the conditions required for optimum production may be quite different from those for survival. Mature M. integrifolia is capable of withstanding mild frosts, but only for short periods. The brittle wood makes trees susceptible to wind damage.
Native range
Australia
Tree management

Seedling growth, initially slow, gathers momentum as saplings produce a series of extension growth flushes in a year. The juvenile phase lasts for 7 years or more, but grafted trees come into bearing after 3 years. The current trend is for high-density hedgerow plantings, which maximize early yields. Inter-row spacing of 10 m is most common (7 m if mechanical pruning is carried out). The distance between rows should be 4-6 m, depending on cultivar and growing conditions. 

Correct branching should be induced at an early age after which there should be no further pruning. During the first 2 years, training (a form of corrective pruning) is done to develop a strong, well-balanced framework for future growth. The young trees should receive careful attention with respect to irrigation, weed control and frost and wind protection. They should also be fertilized to make them grow well and induce early flowering.

Mulching is recommended for young trees (when the trees come into bearing, it interferes with nut collection). Fertilizer management should be guided by leaf and soil analysis, the phenological cycle and yield. Macadamia trees appear to be sensitive to nutrient deficiencies and imbalances, and positive responses to N, P, K, Zn, B, S, Mg, Fe and Cu have been observed.

Yields of 45 kg nuts-in-shell from better trees or an average of 3.2-3.5 t/ha per year are obtained in Hawaii.
Seed storage behaviour is uncertain. Drying until the kernel rattles in the shell does not harm viability; no loss of viability during 4 months of storage in paper bags at room temperature, after which time viability is reduced, and none survives after 12 months. No loss in viability after 12 months of storage in polythene bags at 12 deg. C; viability maintained for 24 months with partially dried seeds at 15 deg. C.

However, the conditions required for optimum production may be quite different from those for survival. Mature M. integrifolia is capable of withstanding mild frosts, but only for short periods. The brittle wood makes trees susceptible to wind damage.
M. integrifolia comes reasonably true to type when raised from seed. Seeds for propagation are selected from vigorous, heavy-bearing trees. The fresh nuts are planted with no pretreatment. 

Grafting may develop desirable clones; side wedge grafting has been used exclusively in Hawaii. Other vegetative propagation methods include splice grafting and cuttings.
  The fine, crunchy texture, rich cream colour and delicate flavour make the macadamia nut one of the finest dessert nuts. The eating quality of the nut is enhanced by lightly roasting it in coconut oil and salting. Raw kernels are also popular alone or in a wide range of confectionery and processed foods. The quality of the kernel is related to its oil content and composition. Nuts are mature when the kernels accumulate 72% or more oil, as determined by specific gravity. Kernels also contain 10% carbohydrates; 9.2% protein, which is low in methionine; 0.7% minerals, particularly potassium;, and niacin, thiamine and riboflavin.
Apiculture:  Macadamia pollen is very attractive to bees, providing necessary forage for honey production.
Macadamia shells may be used as fuel, generating sufficient energy to dry wet, in-shell nuts.
Shade or shelter:  M. integrifolia makes an excellent evergreen shade and shelter due to its thick crown of leaves.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The hulls, the green covering of the nuts, contain approximately 14% of substances suitable for tanning leather.
Lipids:  Macadamia is the richest oil-yielding nut known. The kernel contains more than 75% oil, suitable for human consumption.
Ornamental:  As well as being an evergreen nut-bearing tree, M. integrifolia has good symmetrical shape and when in full bloom is covered with creamy-white and pinkish flowers in long, narrow, drooping racemes. These make it a popular ornamental tree.
Soil improver:  The decomposed husk is commonly used in potting soil.
Intercropping:  Inter-row cropping can be practised with trees such as citrus, if they are removed at 12 years. Macadamia will retard the growth of papaya planted near it.
Essential oil:  The characteristic, subtle macadamia flavour is probably due to volatile compounds, the major ones being similar to those in other roasted nuts."
Macadamia tetraphylla,"Local names:
 English (rough-shelled bush nut,Queensland nut,macadamia nut)
Macadamia tetraphylla is a small to medium sized, densely branched tree, up to 18 m with a diameter of 45 cm (dbh). The outer bark greyish-brown, smooth or finely wrinkled, with numerous cream horizontal lenticels. Branchlets brown to greyish-brown, young shoots hairy.

Leaves in whorls of 4, simple, the margins always pricky-toothed with 33-40 teeth on each side, oblong or oblong lanceolate, 7-25 cm long, 2-5 cm wide, abruptly rounded to a short sharp point at the tip, rigid in texture.

Inflorescence axillary or on the branches, 10-25 cm long; flowers creamy pink to mauve, 10 mm long.

Fruit 20-35 mm in diameter, greyish-green, turning brown. 

Seed 15-30 mm long, pointed at the apex and warty. 

The name tetraphyla is derived from tetra-four phylon-leaf, in allusion to the grouping of leaves in whorls of four.
Ecology

M. tetraphylla is found on sub-coastal low hills and plateau, basaltic shelfs, rocky slopes, ravines, rocky off-shore islands and headlands and in warm, protected fertile valleys of coastal river systems. It is restricted to eastern Australia and extends from extreme north eastern New South Wales to overlap with M. integrifolia in southern Queensland. It occurs in warm sub-humid and humid zones. The average number of frosts vary from 1-4 annually. It withstands mild frosts but only for a short period. Rainfall is distributed through out the year, with a summer maximum.

Associated vegetation include: Argyrodendron trifoliatum, Dysoxylum muelleri and Castanospermun australe. In the drier notophyll vineforest dominant genera are Ficus, Streblus and Casine.
Native range
Australia
Tree management

Pruning is necessary to remove excessive side branching as the trees are prone to breakage and wind-throw on exposed sites. Weed control and fertilizer application may be necessary before the canopy closes. A light crop can be harvested in 4-5 years after planting. Where initial spacing is 14 x 4 m, yields of 6 tons/ha/year can be expected. Macadamia trees are expected to give 40-50 years of productive life.
Mature seed may be stored at 1-2 deg C. for several months in airtight containers.

Associated vegetation include: Argyrodendron trifoliatum, Dysoxylum muelleri and Castanospermun australe. In the drier notophyll vineforest dominant genera are Ficus, Streblus and Casine.
Budding and grafting are the preferred techniques used. The rootstocks are usually seedlings 9-12 months old, produced by sowing freshly harvested, de-husked nuts of selected cultivars. The rootstocks are soaked in tap water for 24 hours in seed boxes, containing coarse river sand. Grafted trees come into production in 3 years.
  Raw kernels (macadamia nuts) are used either alone or in a wide range of confectionery and processed foods. Macadamia oil is also produced. Hawaii dominates the macadamia industry followed by Australia and Costa Rica. The nuts have an excellent flavour, containing up to 76% colorless oil, suitable for human food; the residual cake, after crushing for oil, contains 35-36 % protein. The nut has no starch. Fancy pastries, candies and ice cream, have been made from it. It has the advantage of retaining texture and flavour without becoming stale when used this way.
Macadamia shell may be used as fuel, generating sufficient energy to dry wet, in shell nuts.
Timber:  The wood is reddish, hard and tough, attractively marked, used in small turnery jobs. The timber is not generally exploited.
Shade or shelter:  M. tetraphylla is beautifully proportioned with handsome foliage, making it a fine shade tree.
Intercropping:  In Kenya, it has been inter-cropped with coffee and food crops without affecting the yield of these crops (ICRAF, 1992)."

Tree management

A range of spacings have been used for planting: for example, for the taungya system in Ghana, a spacing of 1.8 x 2.7 m and 5 x 5 m has been used. In case of attack by Fusarium solani, selective thinning should be carried out to remove the affected stems. Thinning is required after the 5th year to allow a proper crown-to-stem ratio to develop. Established plantations may be coppiced. Rotations in plantations are kept at 30-40 years, as older trees are often wind thrown. Rotations are about 8 years for fuelwood, poles and pulp production.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for 1 year at cool temperatures with dry seeds; viability is maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 4-9% mc. There are 700-1000 seeds/kg when the pericarp is removed.
A species of moist forests, widely distributed in forest regrowth and secondary regrowth. In Africa, M. eminii is very common in the ecozone between high forest and savannah. It is an early successional species, adept at colonizing grasslands and disturbed areas in the high forest. In the Budu Forest of Uganda, M. eminii and Piptadenia africana together constitute 80% of the trees. On Sese Island of Lake Victoria, it is found growing in association with Uapaca guineensis, Piptadeniastrum africanum and Canarium schweinfurthii. In the plain high forest or gallery forest of equatorial Sudan, it grows in association with Khaya grandifoliola, Chlorophora excelsa, Funtumia spp., Canarium spp., and Entandophragma spp. It is remarkably long lived for a pioneer species, attaining over 150 years.
Seeds for planting are collected shortly after the fruit fall. The pericarp is removed and seeds are sun dried for a few days. Then they should be sown as soon as possible because they rapidly lose viability. To improve germination, seeds may be soaked in water for 1-2 days, or in concentrated sulphuric acid for 20 minutes.
It is used for reforestation purposes, especially in Zaire.
Fodder: The leaves are used as fodder. Digestibility of the leaves by livestock is excellent and only slightly reduced by heating. The leaves have a dry-matter content of 35%.
Due to its fast growth, M. eminii is widely planted for fuelwood.
Fibre: Sometimes cultivated for fibre.
Timber: The sapwood is light coloured, heartwood brownish-olive to dark red, soft and light with a coarse grain. Wood density varies from 0.38 to 0.48 g/cubic cm. The wood dries rapidly, but logs have a tendency to split during felling and storage. The wood saws and machines easily, and its high absorbency makes it easy to treat with preservatives but difficult to finish. M. eminii wood is used in poles, boxes, crates, millwork, plywood, corestock and lumber construction. Untreated wood is vulnerable to termites and decays in contact with the ground or continual moisture.
Shade or shelter: M. eminii has been successfully used as a shade tree, for example, for coffee in Uganda, cocoa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and cardamom plantations in southern India. It is commonly retained in homegardens for shade. 
Lipids: Analyses of M. eminii seed from Karnataka, India, indicate that they contain 40-50% of an edible oil, the main components of which are stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid.
Medicine: A strong purgative and diuretic can be made by soaking the bark in cold water. The root bark is beaten with clay and used to treat gonorrhoea.
Ornamental: M. eminii is a common ornamental planted along roads."

Kamala tree is common in evergreen forest, especially in secondary forest, and sometimes even dominant in the undergrowth.  Kamala tree withstands considerable shade, it is frost-hardy and resistant to drought.
M. philippensis can be propagated by seeds and root suckers. Seeds should be sown at the beginning of the rainy season in the nursery.  Results carried out in a nursery study in India, indicated that use of a shaded bed, growing media of soil/sand/farm-yard manure at 1:1:1, and a sowing depth of 1.0 cm gave the best germination for M. philippensis seeds (Bahuguna et al., 1996). Seedlings are ready for transplanting in about a year.
It readily colonizes fertile soils.
  Kamala also serves as a preservative for vegetable oils and dairy products.  Kamala also recorded to be used as a dye for food-stuffs and beverages, which seems unlikely because it is generally known as a purgative.
Fodder: The leaves are used as fodder, and in southern China M. philippensis is a host plant for lac insects.
The wood is often used as fuelwood.
Fibre:  The wood is suitable for paper pulp.  The fibrous bark is used to make rope and artificial fur.
Timber: The wood is whitish to pale reddish-grey, often with darker streaks, and fairly close and straight grained; heartwood not distinct; somewhat lustrous, working to a smooth surface under tools, without characteristic odour or taste; hard and moderately heavy, averaging 770 kg/cubic metre. It shrinks considerably and is susceptible to insect attack. The wood is sometimes used as timber for implements.
Shade or shelter: In India M. philippensis is considered to be a valuable nurse tree for more important forest tree species, e.g. sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.f.).
Tannin or dyestuff:  The granules which cover the ripe fruit are used in India as a dye ('kamala') for dyeing silk and wool bright orange. A red dye has been extracted from the roots.
Lipids: The seeds yield kamala seed oil which can be used as a substitute for tung oil, obtained from Aleurites spp., in the production of rapid-drying paints and varnishes. The seed oil is also used as a fixative in cosmetic preparations. The oil is also used as a fixative in cosmetic preparations and for colouring foodstuffs and beverages.
Medicine: In pharmacy kamala is used as anthelmintic and an extract of kamala in hexachlorethane may be useful in treating liver fluke in cattle.  Kamala is also known to affect the fertility of animal and man.  All parts of the tree can be applied externally to treat parasitic infections of the skin.  The fruits and bark have been reported to be used medicinally to treat stomach ulcers and tapeworm.
Intercropping: The tree is usually planted in rows with field crops."
Malpighia glabra,"Local names:
 English (West Indian cherry), French (cerise-antillaise), Thai (choeri), Vietnamese (so'ri)
Malpighia glabra  is a shrub or small evergreen tree, 2-3(-6) m tall, with spreading, more or less drooping branches on a short trunk.

Leaves opposite, ovate to elliptic-lanceolate, 2-8 cm x 1-4 cm, entire or undulating, dark green and glossy above, petiole short.

Inflorescences sessile or short-peduncled axillary cymes with 3-5 flowers; flowers bisexual, 1-2 cm in diameter, pinkish to reddish; calyx with 6-10 large sessile glands; petals 5, fringed, slender-clawed; stamens 10, filaments united below.

Fruit a bright-red, juicy drupe, depressed-ovoid, 1-3 cm in diameter and weighing 3-5 g, usually in pairs or threes, obscurely 3-lobed; skin thin, flesh soft, orange, acid to subacid.

Seeds 3, triangular, ridged.

In Florida, 'Florida Sweet' is a high-yielding cultivar.

A distinction is sometimes made in nomenclature between wild and cultivated (improved) plants, the latter being called M. punicifolia L.  It is now, however, generally accepted that both taxa belong to M. glabra.  M. coccigera L. and M. urens L. are incidentally cultivated in South-East Asia for the same purposes as M. glabra.
Ecology

Acerola can be grown almost anywhere in the tropics and warm subtropics.  Young plants are killed by frost, but mature trees survive brief exposure to -2 deg. C.  The plants tolerate long periods of drought and do not stand waterlogging.
Native range
Puerto Rico, United States of America
Tree management

The recommended spacing is 3-4 m on the square, or in double rows, e.g. (4 + 2) m x 3 m.  NPK fertilization twice a year and application of organic material are recommended for Puerto Rico. Bearing will be enhanced if mature plants are judiciously pruned after the main crop, followed by a top dressing. Trees start to produce well 3-4 years after planting and continue for 15 years. Individual trees may produces 15-30 kg of fruits per year, whereas yields per hectare per year may vary considerably: (10-)15-25(-65) t.
 
Acerola can be grown almost anywhere in the tropics and warm subtropics.  Young plants are killed by frost, but mature trees survive brief exposure to -2 deg. C.  The plants tolerate long periods of drought and do not stand waterlogging.
Fully developed seeds should be used for planting.  The germination of the seed is slow (5-50%).  Acerola may also be propagated vegetatively by cuttings, budding or grafting.
 The sour fruits are eaten fresh, but more often preserved with sugar, e.g. in the form of jam.  The edible pulp represents about half of the fruit weight and contains per 100 g: water 82-91 g, protein 0.7-1.8 g, fat 0.1-0.2 g, carbohydrates 7-14 g, fibre 0.6-1.2 g, ash 0.8 g.  The energy value is 247 kJ per 100 g.  The fruit -particularly when immature- is one of the richest sources of vitamin C, containing up to 4.7 g per 100 g edible portion. Juice is used commercially to enrich other fruit juices low in vitamin C. Canned juice and frozen fruit are exported to the United States, where they are used to enrich fruit preserves and are marketed as baby foods.
Timber: The wood, which is hard and heavy, can be used for small utensils.
Tannin or dyestuff: The bark has been used for tannin.
Medicine: The fruits are considered beneficial against liver problems, diarrhoea, dysentery, coughs and colds.
Ornamental:  The plants have ornamental value.
The plants are suitable for hedges.
Other services: The plants are very suitable for backyards and places where children play (to eat the fruits and to climb the trees)."
Mammea africana,"Local names:
 English (bastard mahogany,African mammey apple,African apricot,African apple), Spanish (mamey)
Mammea africana is a fairly common large forest tree reaching heights of 40 m or more and 1 m in trunk diameter.

Leaves dark green, glossy, oblong, 32 cm x 9 cm. Young leaves copper-red when they emerge, but darken on maturity.

Fruits large and round, normally 10-12cm in diameter. Outer skin rough and leathery, light brown in color. Inside is a fibrous white/yellow flesh that is consumed.  This mushy flesh surrounds 1-2 large seeds approximately 6-8 cm in size.

The generic name is from a West Indian name, ‘mammey’ for a member of the genus. The specific epithet means ‘of African origin’.
Native range
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Liberia
Tree management

Due to their large sizes at maturity, a spacing of 8 m between trees is recommended. M. africana is shade-tolerant, but as it grows older, shading should be removed gradually. Initial organic mulching around the base of the tree extending as far out as the branches can reach is beneficial.
Direct seeding is the normal mode of propagating M. africana.
 Its fruits are edible. When they soften, the fruits are sliced open and the flesh consumed, leaving the seed(s) and the skin. It has a good flavour, but sometimes quite acidic. Some trees produce sweet, less acidic fruit, while others, sour, acidic fruits.
Timber:  M. africana is one of the timber species exported from Ghana. It is used for construction, furniture, exterior joinery, carpentry work and railway sleepers.
Medicine:  The resinous sap, or a lotion made from its roots, is used in West Africa for any pruriginous skin disease (craw-craw) and parasitic skin diseases. The bark shavings are used as rubbings for skin eruptions and for itch in dogs; a bark decoction is used for rheumatic pains and to clear ulcers; and a thick paste of pulped fruits, mixed with root and bark infusion, is painted on itch and other skin afflictions and allowed to dry.
Ornamental: The tree’s branching habit and overall form is quite ornamental and would look handsome as a yard tree."
Mammea americana,"Local names:
 English (St. Domingo apricot,South American apricot,mammee apple,mamme,mamey), French (abricot d' Amerique,abricot de Saint-Dominque,abricot des Antilles,abricot pays,abricotier sauvage), Portuguese (abrico selvagem,pecego de Sao Domingos,abricote,abrico
Mammea americana is an evergreen tree, 18-21 m tall, with a short trunk that may attain 0.9-1.2 m in diameter, and ascending, densely foliaged branches forming an erect, oval head.

Leaves glossy, opposite, leathery, dark-green, broadly elliptic leaves, up to 20 cm long and 10 cm wide. 

Flowers fragrant, white, 2.5-4 cm wide when fully open, may be staminate, pistilate or polygamous; borne singly or in clusters of 2 or 3 on axils of young branches. Male, female and hermaphrodite together or on separate trees. 

Fruit nearly round or somewhat irregular, with a short, thick stem and a more or less distinct tip or merely a bristle-like floral remnant at the apex, ranges from 10-20 cm in diameter, is heavy (0.5-2 kg) and hard until fully ripe when it softens slightly. The skin is light brown or greyish-brown with small, scattered, warty or scurfy areas, leathery, about 3 mm thick and bitter. Beneath it, a thin, dry, whitish membrane, astringent and often bitter, adheres to the flesh. The latter is light or golden-yellow to orange, non-fibrous, varies from firm and crisp and sometimes dry to tender, melting and juicy. It is more or less free from the seed though bits of the seed covering, which may be bitter, usually adhere to the immediately surrounding wall of flesh. The ripe flesh is appetizingly fragrant and, in the best varieties, pleasantly sub acid, resembling the apricot or red raspberry in flavor. Fruits of poor quality may be too sour or mawkishly sweet. Small fruits are usually single-seeded; larger fruits may have 2, 3 or 4 seeds.

Seed russet-brown, rough, ovoid or ellipsoid and about 6.25 cm long. The juice of the seed leaves an indelible stain.

The generic name is from a West Indian name, ‘mammey’ for a member of the genus. The specific epithet means ‘of American origin’.
Ecology

The mamey is limited to tropical or near tropical moist to wet climates. In Central America, it thrives from near sea-level to 1 000 m. It is frost tender. Within its natural range, mamey is most frequently found in semi-cultivation or in areas that have been disturbed. Consequently, it is frequently associated with exotic and aggressive native secondary species such as Mangifera indica, Spathodea campanulata and Artocarpus altilis.
Native range
Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico
Tree management

Spacing of 10 m is recommended if fruit is going to be cultivated, closer spacing is desirable for wood production. Mamey coppices well and generally receives little or no cultural attention, apart from protection from cold during the first few winters in other than strictly tropical climates. It seems remarkably resistant to pests and diseases.
Seed may be recalcitrant; viability is maintained for 2-4 months in moist storage at 20 deg C. There are about 14 seeds/kg.

Consequently, it is frequently associated with exotic and aggressive native secondary species such as Mangifera indica, Spathodea campanulata and Artocarpus altilis.
Seeds are the usual means of propagation and they germinate in 1-4 months with a 97% rate. Seeds sprout readily in leaf-mulch under the tree. Grown under light shade, seedlings reach 40-50 cm and are ready to out-plant 3-5 months after sowing. Vegetative propagation is preferable to avoid raising male trees and to achieve earlier fruiting; grafting the mamey onto self-seedlings has also been successfully employed.
Poison:  All parts of the mamey have insecticidal properties; infusions of the powdered seeds and gum from the bark and green fruit rind are used as insecticides to kill ticks, fleas and jiggers. In Puerto Rico mamey leaves are wrapped around young tomato plants when setting them in the ground to protect them from mole crickets and cutworms. Various extracts from the fruit, bark, leaves or roots are toxic to moths, beetle larvae and also to bugs. Seed extracts are toxic to fish, chicks and hogs. 
Erosion control:  The large spreading lateral roots prevent soil erosion.
  The fruit may be eaten fresh or made into preserves and is used as filler for products made of other fruits. Slightly under-ripe fruits, rich in pectin, are made into jelly.
The tree is used as fuel.
Timber:  The heartwood is reddish or purple-brown; sapwood much lighter in color. Wood hard and heavy with a specific gravity of 0.86-0.98 g/cu cm, easy to work, fine-grained and strong; has an attractive grain and polishes well. It is useful in cabinetwork, valued for pillars, rafters, decorative features of fine houses, interior sheathing, turnery and posts since it is fairly decay-resistant. It is, however, highly susceptible to termites. 
Shade or shelter:  The mammey is planted as a shade and windbreak.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The tannin from the bark is sometimes used for home treatment of leather in the Virgin Islands. 
Medicine:  Uses of mamey in folk medicine include treatment of scalp infections, diarrhoea, digestive and eye problems. In Venezuela, powdered seeds are employed in the treatment of parasitic skin diseases. In Brazil, the ground seeds, minus the embryo which is considered convulsant, infusion is employed as an anthelmintic for adults only. In the French West Indies, an aromatic liqueur called Eau de Creole or Creme de Creole, is distilled from the flowers and said to act as a tonic or digestive. An infusion of the fresh or dry leaves is given in cases of intermittent fever.
Ornamental:  Mammey’s dark-green, shiny leaves and dense foliage make it a beautiful ornamental tree; it is planted for shade around houses, parks and along streets.
Trees are usually planted along boundaries and fences.
Alcohol:  Wine is made from the fruit and fermented toddy from the sap of the tree in Brazil. Liquor is distilled from fermented flowers"
Mangifera caesia,"Local names:
 Danish (binjai), Filipino (bayuno), Indonesian (palong,binglu), Javanese (binglu), Malay (sedaman,beluno), Thai (lam-yaa,bin-ya), Trade name (machang)
Mangifera caesia is a large tree, often attaining majestic proportions, 30(- 45) m tall, and bole 50-80(-120) cm or more in diameter; bole columnar, without buttresses, crown dome-shaped with massive branches; bark greyish-brown, superficially fissured, containing irritant sap. 

Leaves elliptic to lanceolate, more or less obovate, (7-)10-12(-30) cm x (3-)4-5.5(-10) cm, medium green and shiny above, paler below, often crowded at the end of stout branchlets, coriaceous, blunt or bluntly acuminate; midrib thick, flattened, raised above, base gradually decurrent; petiole stout, flattened, 1-1.5(-2.5) cm long. 

Panicle terminal, 15-25(-40) cm long, much branched with stout rachis and branches, densely flowered, pale pink; flowers 5-merous, pale lilac, fragrant; petals linear, up to 10 mm long, not strongly reflexed as in most other mango flowers, only slightly reflexed in the upper part; fertile stamen 1, filament 5 mm long, white at base, purple towards the apex, 4 teeth-like staminodes; disc narrow, stipe-like, 1-1.5 mm long, pale green; ovary obliquely globose, reddish brown, style excentric, 8 mm long, white, becoming violet after anthesis. 

Fruit an obovate-oblong drupe, necked at base, 12-15(-20) cm x 6-7(-12) cm; skin yellowish or pale brownish, very thin (1 mm); pulp whitish, soft and juicy, fibrous, with a peculiar sourish taste and strong smell at maturity. The 'wani' form: fruit ellipsoid, rounded, 9-11 cm x 6.5-7 cm, glossy pale green at maturity, flesh milky white; the best forms are almost fibreless with a sweet pleasant taste; stone ellipsoid-lanceolate, ca. 7 cm x 3.5-4 cm, not flattened, thin-walled, endocarp not woody, made of matted coarse fibres, monoembryonic. 

Wild forms have sour fruits but there is a cultivar in Borneo and Bali with sweet, fibreless and tasty fruits. The smell of the fruit pulp is rather offensive, and the white juice of the immature fruit is very irritating to the skin and when ingested.

M. caesia closely resembles M. kemanga Blume, but differs in the longer petiole and the yellowish or whitish-green and smooth fruit.
Ecology

M. caesia are restricted to the wet tropical lowlands, generally below 400 m (rarely up to 800 m). It require a rainfall which is evenly distributed through the year. It also stand inundation well and are commonly cultivated on periodically inundated riverbanks in East Kalimantan.  It is rather rare in forests and found more frequently in periodically inundated areas and marshes.

It also stand inundation well and are commonly cultivated on periodically inundated riverbanks in East Kalimantan.  It is rather rare in forests and found more frequently in periodically inundated areas and marshes.
It is propagated from seed, an indication that the agronomy of the crops has received little attention. Presumably grafting on seedling stock would be possible, in particular through inarching potted, decapitated rootstocks into twigs of mother trees. Grafting on Mangifera indica L. has been attempted without success, probably because this species is not closely related.
Poison: The white juice of the immature binjai fruit is extremely irritant, both on the skin and when ingested,
 The juicy, sweetish-sour binjai fruit can be eaten fresh when ripe. The 'wani' form, which is mainly found in Bali but also in East Kalimantan, is much liked this way and fetches a high price in local markets, as the fruit is palatable, juicy and sweet, almost fibreless, the foetid rank smell being completely absent. It is excellent for making creamy juices. Binjai is often used to prepare a spice based on chillies ('sambal') which is eaten with river fish. In some areas the flesh of ripe fruit is pickled and preserved with salt in jars, to be able to make this sambal when there is no fresh fruit.  About 65% of the binjai fruit is edible. Per 100 g edible portion the constituents are: water 86.5 g, protein 1 g, fat 0.2 g, carbohydrates including fibre 11.9 g, ash 0.4 g, thiamine 0.08 mg, beta-carotene equivalent 0.005 mg and vitamin C 58 mg. The energy value is 200 kJ/100 g.

Mangifera foetida is a tree up to 30-35 m tall, straight bole without buttresses, bark light brown to dark greyish-brown, shallowly fissured with broad flat ridges, containing irritant whitish sap turning black on exposure; crown dense, foliage dark green, branches massive. 

Leaves elliptic-oblong to broadly elliptic, sometimes oblanceolate, 15-40 cm x 9-15 cm, stiffly coriaceous, dark green above, clear green below, apex sub-acute, sometimes rounded or slightly emarginate, base cuneate or attenuate, more or less bullate between the nerves; petiole 1.5-8 cm, stout, very swollen at the base. 

Panicles subterminal, upright, pyramidal, 10-40 cm long, sparsely branched, rather densely flowered, deep reddish-pink, inflorescence axes stout, deeply red to copper red; flowers 5-merous, scentless; sepals obovate- lanceolate, 4-5 mm long; petals narrowly lanceolate, 6-9 mm x 1.5-2.5 mm, pale reddish-pink at the base, pale yellow towards the apex, reflexed; stamens 5, 1(-2) fertile, filament ca. 8 mm long, pinkish-purple, anthers dark violet, other ones smaller, filaments connate at the base; ovary subglobose, yellow, style excentric, white, 6-7 mm long.

Fruit variable in size and shape, an obliquely ovoid-oblong or almost globose drupe, 9-14(-16) cm x 7-12 cm, dirty dark olive-green or yellowish-green, smooth, dull, with brown lenticels, nose reduced to a point or slightly prominent, rarely prominent, skin ca. 5 mm thick; flesh pale orange yellow or yellow, fibrous, juicy, with strong smell and taste of turpentine at its full extent. Stone plump, ca. 6 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm, coarsely fibrous; seed monoembryonic. 

Different forms are recognized by local people. Small, almost globose fruits (e.g. 'limus piit' in West Java) are consistently distinguished from large and more oblong ones which are commonly sold in Malay markets. There is also another kind, with large, oblong fruits, remarkable for being hardly fibrous, and finer textured. In West Java, it is called 'limus tipung' ('tipung' meaning flour, referring to its fine texture). A similar kind ('asem linggau') was found in East Kalimantan, with, moreover, a large proportion of fruit having abortive seeds. Sizeable variability in fruit characters is recorded in Borneo, particularly in South Kalimantan.
Ecology

The species occur chiefly in primary lowland forest in the wet tropics. In Peninsular Malaysia, it is the most important representative of the machang trade group found scattered in natural forest. They are adapted to areas with abundant rainfall, evenly distributed over the year.

The species occur chiefly in primary lowland forest in the wet tropics. In Peninsular Malaysia, it is the most important representative of the machang trade group found scattered in natural forest. They are adapted to areas with abundant rainfall, evenly distributed over the year.
Propagation is by seed. The seedlings require much moisture and light shade. They tolerate much shade but later on grow also well in full light. M. foetida proved to be a suitable rootstock for cvs of M. indica in a moist climate, but others doubt this because of swellings at the union. Budding is performed after the modified Forkert method with buds of non-petioled wood on one-year-old rootstocks, during the dry season.
 Fresh bachang fruit contain an irritant juice which may inflame the lips and mouth. At maturity the irritant juice is restricted to the skin, so that the ripe fruit can be eaten fresh if it is peeled fairly thick. It is a rather savoury fruit, in spite of its turpentine smell and the taste sometimes is likened to durian, but it is not generally valued as a table fruit. Unripe fruit, washed in salted water and sliced is used in vegetable salads ('rujak') and in a sour pickle ('asinan'). In Borneo, especially in East Kalimantan, the fruit commonly replaces tamarind as an acid ingredient in the preparation of sambal. In Malaysia it is used to make chutneys as well as pickles.  The edible portion of M. foetida represents 65% of fruit weight. Per 100 g edible portion the flesh contains: water 72.5 g, protein 1.4 g, carbohydrates 25.4 g, calcium 21 mg, phosphorus 15 mg, thiamine 0.03 mg, beta-carotene equivalent 0.218 mg and vitamin C 56 mg.
Timber: The density of the wood is 545-785 kg/m cubic at 15% moisture content. The wood is not durable, but is suitable for light indoor constructions, temporary constructions and plywood.  Streaked heartwood is suitable for the manufacture of furniture.
Medicine: The leaves are said to be antipyretic and the seeds used against trichophytosis, scabies and eczema.
Ornamental:  In flower M. foetida is a beautiful ornamental with upright inflorescences."

Inner bark light brown and bitter. A whitish latex exudes from cut twigs and a resin from cuts in the trunk.

Leaves alternate, simple, leathery, oblong-lanceolate, 16-30 x 3-7 cm, on flowering branches, up to 50 cm on sterile branches, curved upward from the midrib and sometimes with edges a little wavy. Young leaves red, aging to shiny dark green above, lighter below, with yellow or white venation; petioles 4.5 cm long, striate and swollen at the base.

Inflorescence 16 cm or more in length, a much-branched panicle bearing many very small (4 mm) greenish-white or pinkish flowers. Flowers radially symmetrical, usually have 5 spreading petals, 3-5 mm long, 1-1.5 mm broad, streaked with red, imbricate, with the median petal prolonged like a crest at the base, finely hairy and fragrant, partly male and partly bisexual; stalk short; 5 stamens, 1 fertile, the other 4 shorter and sterile, borne in a disc. The flower has a conspicuous 5-lobed disc between the petals and stamens. Calyx yellow-green, very short, deeply 5-lobed; 5 sepals, each 2-2.5 mm long x 1-1.5 mm broad, green with whitish margin, or yellowish-green, hairy outside.

Fruit an irregularly egg-shaped and slightly compressed fleshy drupe, 8-12 (max. 30) cm long, attached at the broadest end on a pendulous stalk. The skin smooth, greenish-yellow, sometimes tinged with red. The underlying yellow-orange flesh varies in quality from soft, sweet, juicy and fibre-free in high-quality selected (clonal) varieties to turpentine flavoured and fibrous in wild seedlings. The single, compressed-ovoid seed is encased in the white fibrous inner layer of the fruit.

The generic name is derived from ‘mango’, the Indian name for the fruit, and the Latin ‘fero’ (‘I bear’).
Ecology

The mango thrives in both the subtropics and the tropics. In the subtropics, the cold months ensure excellent floral induction, but late frosts are a major risk; tender parts of the tree are killed by frost. In the tropics, the mango grows anywhere up to 1200 m elevation, but for fruit production a prominent dry season lasting more than 3 months is necessary. A flowering flush is produced during the dry season, but—contrary to the subtropics—flowering is erratic and a yield-limiting factor. At elevations above 600 m in the tropics, the climate becomes too cool for the commercial cultivars, the optimum temperature being about 24-27 deg. C. 

The trees are drought tolerant but do not seem to suffer from occasional flooding. Frequently found in coastal areas. Trees shade out grasses because of their thick crowns.
Native range
Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar
Tree management

Irrigation in the 1st years after planting promotes flushing (and suppresses flowering), so that tree size increases quickly. Irrigation also widens the scope for intercropping, for example, with papaya, banana, pineapple or vegetables, during the establishment phase. When the trees are big enough to produce a substantial crop, irrigation is stopped, or at least interrupted long enough to impose quiescence leading to flower initiation. Trees of most cultivars have a dense canopy, and with a little weeding the orchard floor can be kept clean.

To ensure good, balanced and productive growth, the mango seedlings should be pruned. The main stem of the hardy trees is allowed to grow to 1 m before being topped to give well-distributed branches. In fruiting trees, pruning is confined to the removal of dead wood and branches broken or weakened by pests and diseases.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant; there is complete loss in viability within 7 days in open storage at 30 deg. C. Viability can be maintained for 120 days with subimbibed seeds stored at 15 deg. C; no loss in viability of excised embryonic axes on fast desiccation to 11.8% mc. Seeds are damaged by chilling to temperatures below 3-6 deg. C. They require no pretreatment, but nicking enhances germination. Fresh seeds germinate at temperatures between 5 and 40 deg. C, with germination being most rapid between 25 and 40 deg. C. The germination rate of fresh stones is generally over 80%, with the normal rate ranging from 60 to 90%. Sowing complete fruit or stones with the pulp attached delays germination by up to 7 weeks, and germination rate is only 30-50%. Mature mango seeds have a high mc and cannot withstand desiccation; desiccation below 30% mc will kill them. Wet storage of stones at 15 deg. C is possible, but germinating seeds develop roots about 5 cm long and shoots about 8 cm long after 6 months. There are up to 50 seeds/kg.

The trees are drought tolerant but do not seem to suffer from occasional flooding. Frequently found in coastal areas. Trees shade out grasses because of their thick crowns.
Worldwide, most mangos are propagated from seed. Preferably, large and fully developed stones should be sown. Careful removal of the endocarp, releasing the seed, results in earlier and more uniform germination, producing seedlings with a straight stem and roots. However, this method is not feasible for commercial production of planting stock. Stones should be sown under shade, and seedlings also require a certain amount of shade. Those that are raised in nursery beds can be transplanted without much difficulty before the taproot has developed to any great extent. However, seedlings raised in baskets or containers are preferable. Selected varieties may also be propagated vegetatively by grafting the rootstock of the same or other Mangifera species and by budding.
Poison: In sensitive individuals, ingestion of the fruit or skin contact with the juice may cause a rash like that of poison ivy.
 Mango is cultivated for the fruit, which can be eaten in 3 distinct ways, depending largely on the cultivar: unripe (mature green, very popular in Thailand and the Philippines), ripe (the common way to enjoy mango throughout the world), and processed (at various stages of maturity, in the form of pickles or chutneys, dried slices, canned slices in syrup, juice and puree or paste). The fruit is surrounded by golden, juicy flesh, rich in vitamins A and C. The green fruit is also used to flavour fish and meat dishes in the same way as tamarind and other sour fruits. In India, the kernels are important as a famine food, but the astringency has to be removed by boiling, roasting and soaking them for a long time. Young leaves are cooked as a vegetable.
Fodder: Mango leaves are occasionally fed to cattle, but large quantities can cause death. Seed kernels are a byproduct of processing; they can be used as feed for cattle and poultry.
Apiculture: M. indica is an important honey plant, secreting large quantities of nectar.
With a calorific value of 4200 kcal/kg, the wood makes excellent charcoal and firewood.
Timber: Heartwood is pale yellowish-brown to reddish-brown, darkening on exposure, not clearly demarcated from the pale yellowish-brown sapwood. Grain somewhat wavy, texture moderately coarse; freshly cut wood is scentless. The wood is used for many purposes, including indoor construction, meat-chopping blocks, furniture, carpentry, flooring, boxes, crates and boat building (canoes and dugouts).
Shade or shelter: Its umbrella-shaped crown makes the mango tree a suitable shade for people and their livestock; it also acts as a firebreak.
Tannin or dyestuff: Bark is the source of a yellowish-brown dye used for silk.
Medicine: Charred and pulverized leaves make a plaster to remove warts and also act as a styptic. Seeds are used to treat stubborn colds and coughs, obstinate diarrhoea and bleeding piles. The bark is astringent, homeostatic and antirheumatic.
Soil improver: Mango leaves improve soil fertility when used as mulch for crops.
Intercropping: Young mango is often interplanted with other fruits and vegetables, and the tree is a valued component of the traditional homegarden agroforestry system."
Mangifera odorata,"Local names:
 English (saipan mango), Filipino (uani,kuwini), French (manguier,Mangue odorante), Indonesian (kuweni,kaweni,Bembem), Malay (wani,huani), Thai (Ma-mut,mamuang chingreet)
Mangifera odorata is a medium-sized tree, 10-15 m, rarely exceeding 20 m height; crown globose or broadly ovoid; bole straight, bark grey, containing irritant sap.

Leaves irregularly scattered on rather thick branchlets, oblong-lanceolate, 12-35 cm x 4-10 cm, coriaceous-chartaceous, edge not wavy, shortly acuminate, with prominent reticulated veins especially on the lower surface, not or hardly odorous when bruised, petiole 3-7 cm, swollen at base.

Panicles terminal, pyramidal, 15-50 cm long, rather densely flowered, rachis yellowish-green tinged with reddish-brown; flowers 5(-6)-merous, ca. 6 mm wide, fragrant; sepals ovate, 3-4 mm long, brown-red or partly green; petals lanceolate, ca. 5-6 mm x 1.2-2 mm, yellowish at the base, pale pinkish towards the apex, reflexed, with 3-5 fingers ('ridges') on ca. 2/3 of the length of the petals, confluent at the base, pale yellow becoming dark red; stamens 5(-6), only 1 fertile, filament 5 mm long, staminodes 1.5-2 mm long; ovary subglobose, yellowish, style excentric, 3-5 mm long, dark red. 

Fruit an obliquely ellipsoid-oblong, hardly flattened drupe, 10-13 cm x 6-9 cm, green to yellowish-green, sparingly spotted with dark brown lenticels; rind rather thick (3-4 mm); flesh orange-yellow, firm, fibrous, sourish-sweet, juicy, with a pungent smell and taste of turpentine. Stone 8-10 cm x 4.5-5 cm x 2.5-3 cm, covered with rather soft fibres. 

Seed frequently polyembryonic.

The species possibly represents hybrid forms between M. indica and M. foetida.

M. odorata is a polymorphic species. In West Java several forms are distinguished: - 'bembem', an inferior form: the fruit has a strong smell and taste of turpentine reminiscent of the fruit of M. foetida, the leaves are coriaceous; - 'kaweni', with less fibrous flesh and a mild taste of turpentine; the best forms are very palatable; - 'gandarassa' of the Banten area in West Java, a rare and poorly known form which is said to be superior to 'kaweni', less sweet but more juicy and with a less strong smell. In the Philippines 'sangay', known from Jolo, is distinguished by its yellow colour at maturity from the greenish 'huani' fruit.
Ecology

M. odorata thrives below 1000 m in tropical areas with a fairly heavy rainfall that is equally distributed throughout the year, although it grows even with a moderate rainfall (1200 mm) provided there are no prolonged dry periods. It is found for instance on the dry islands of the western part of the Sulu Archipelago.
Native range
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Plantation: Planting distance is 12-14 m.

It is mainly grown mixed with other tree species in homegardens and village orchards. It is a dominant fruit tree in some villages specialized in kuwini production near Solok, West Sumatra, where vegetables or bananas are grown under the relatively light foliage of old trees.

It is found for instance on the dry islands of the western part of the Sulu Archipelago.
M. odorata is usually propagated by seed, only rarely by grafting; marcotting is possible but difficult. Budding on the mango proved to be successful, but where M. indica was the scion, symptoms of incompatibility developed after two years.
 The kuwini is a popular fruit, having local economic significance in areas where Mangifera indica L. cannot be grown satisfactorily because the climate is very wet. The fruits, especially those that are less fibrous and smell less strongly, are much appreciated as table fruit. They must be peeled thick because of the presence of an acrid juice in the skin, which can also be reduced by steeping in diluted lime-water before eating. They are also used for making chutney and for pickles with salt. In Java a kind of flour is made of the seed kernels and used in the preparation of delicacies such as 'dodol' (based on glutinous rice) and 'jenang pelok' (a thick pappy preparation from Curcuma rhizomes).  About 70% of the fruit is edible. Per 100 g edible portion the fruit contains: water 80 g, protein 0.9 g, fat 0.1 g, carbohydrates including fibre 18.5 g, ash 0.6 g, beta-carotene equivalent 0.36 mg, thiamine 0.04 mg, riboflavin 0.06 mg, niacin 0.7 mg and vitamin C 13 mg. The energy value is 290 kJ/100 g.
Timber: The wood is used locally as machang, but is reportedly of poor quality.
Medicine: In folk medicine, the bark is recommended for external application in hystero-epilepsy, in the form of a compound like a cosmetic mixture."
Manihot glaziovii,"Local names:
 English (tree cassava), French (manioc de ceara,maniçoba,ceara,caouchouc de ceara), Portuguese (manicoba), Swahili (mpira), Yoruba (gbaguda)
Manihot glaziovii is a glabrous shrub or tree to 6 m high, occasionally taller (10-20 m), often with several weak branches from near the base. Bark papery, peeling, dark reddish brown. Young shoots glaucous.

Leaves deeply palmipartite, 3-5 lobed, peltate. Cordate, membranous-chartaceous, lobes broadly ovate to obovate, (4-)7-12(-15) cm long, (2-)4-8(-10) wide, entire. Green above, glaucous beneath, petiole to 25 cm long, often tinged reddish. Stipules lanceolate 5 mm long, entire, decidous.

Inflorescence paniculate, to 12 cm long, bracts resembling the stipules. Male flowers 7-9 mm long, female flowers 0.8-1.4 cm long extending to 2-3 cm in fruit.

Fruit globose 1.9-2 cm by 1.9-2.2 cm, smooth, muricate-tuberculate, endocarp woody.
Ecology

M. glaziovii occurs throughout the semi-arid Caatinga region of northeastern Brazil on intermediate slopes and elevations, particularly near the base or on lower slopes of the sierras or buttes common to most of northeastern Brazil.
Native range
Brazil, Colombia
Tree management

M. glaziovii can be tapped at the age of 3 years.
Seed storage is orthodox: dry seeds (10 %) survive 24 hrs in liquid nitrogen. Seeds tolerate desiccation to 3.7 % mc when they do not lose viability in subsequent hermitic storage at -200 deg C.
M. glaziovii occurs throughout the semi-arid Caatinga region of northeastern Brazil on intermediate slopes and elevations, particularly near the base or on lower slopes of the sierras or buttes common to most of northeastern Brazil.
M. glaziovii can be propagated either from cuttings or direct seeding.
  The leaves yield a white plastic substance, which is not rubber. Hydrocyanic acid is also produced in them, but this is dissipated by heat and they are eaten cooked as a vegetable in Gabon and in East Africa. The root is rich in starch but it is hard and woody, and also produces hydrocyanic acid. It is eaten in times of food scarcity.
In Senegal, young branches are fed to sheep and goats. Ceara leaves have a 25 % to 30 % dry matter protein content. However, cattle in Brazil suffer from hydrocyanic acid poisoning when they consume wilted leaves of the manicoba tree.
Apiculture:  The flowers are freely visited by bees and the wax could be of importance.
Shade or shelter:  It is used for temporary shade for cocoa in West Africa.
Medicine: The stem and root enter into a Nigerian remedy for skin infections.
Ornamental: The plant is still widely grown as an ornamental.
In some areas the species is used as a hedge especially in areas of low rainfall.
Soil improver:  Applied as green leaf manure.
Latex or rubber:  M. glaziovii was planted mainly for rubber production. The rubber is said to be of good appearance, but resin content at 3-12% is too high, thus it is considered uneconomical when there are other sources. The Fula of Nigeria use the late
Essential oil:  M. glaziovii produces many seeds which contain 90 % unsaturated oil which might possibly be used as a fuel for pre-combustion diesel engines.
Other services:  Used in breeding programmes, to improve disease resistance especially of cassava.  Drought tolerant thus suitable for planting in the Sahel, North Africa and Brazil."
Manilkara zapota,"Local names:
 Creole (sapoti), English (chickle gum,common naseberry,sapodilla,chicle tree,naseberry), Filipino (chico), French (sapotilleir,sapotillier commun,sapotille), German (Breiapfelßaum,Sapodilla,Kaugummißaum), Hindi (chiku), Indonesian (sawo londo,ciku,sawo m
The sapodilla is a large, evergreen, forest tree more than 30 m in height and with a diameter up to 1.5 m; under cultivation it varies between 9 and 15 m, depending on location, and generally does not exceed 50 cm in diameter. It produces a dense crown and a characteristic branching system (sympodial), in which the young branches are arranged horizontally. Bole cylindrical and long, especially in forest-grown individuals; bark dark brown and deeply fissured, forming small rectangular pieces. The tree has an extensive root system.

Leaves spirally arranged and clustered at the shoot tips, simple, elliptic or oblong, apex obtuse to shortly acuminate; coriaceous, shining, glabrous when mature. Secondary veins make a wide angle with the midrib.

Flowers greenish, solitary, cyathiform or campanulate, with a brown pubescent peduncle; 6 sepals, 6 corolla lobes.

Fruit an ovoid to globular berry with a rough brown skin, containing 1-12 shining, brown or black seeds (frequently 5), surrounded by a brownish, sweet, juicy, scented flesh.

‘Manilkara’ is a common name for a member of the genus in Malabar. The common name ‘sapodilla’, by which the fruit is known, is taken from the Spanish ‘zapotillo’ meaning ‘small zapote’.
Ecology

M. zapota is a species of the lowland rainforest. Trees grow well in a wide range of climatic conditions from wet tropics to dry cool subtropical areas. But they prefer a moist hot climate similar to that found at medium to low elevations in tropical areas, such as in coastal regions. Fruiting is not adversely affected by heavy rainfall, but high temperatures (42-43 deg. C) are harmful. Trees prefer full sunshine and are fairly hardy and resistant to wind damage when mature. Young trees are frost tender and may be killed at freezing point or below, whereas mature trees can withstand short periods of temperatures of about -3 deg. C.
Native range
Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela
Tree management

Trees are spaced 7-12 m apart, depending on the growth habit of the cultivar. They require irrigation during the dry season for the 1st 3-4 years, after which they are able to withstand drought. If necessary, young plants should be staked. Response to fertilizer is good, and 3-4 small applications a year of a nitrogen-containing fertilizer are beneficial. Pruning to shape the young trees is practised for the 1st 5 or 6 years. Planting a strong windbreak is also advised to protect against prevailing winds.
Seed storage behaviour is intermediate; viability can be maintained for 24 months in air-dry storage at 5 deg. C.

Young trees are frost tender and may be killed at freezing point or below, whereas mature trees can withstand short periods of temperatures of about -3 deg. C.
Commercial varieties are cultivated by vegetative means: air-layering, marcoting, inarching and grafting. For air-layering, 2-year-old branches are used, 45-60 cm long, 1 cm in diameter and suitably leafy. For grafting, seedlings, or those of Mimusops kauki or Madhuca spp. (related genera of the same family) are used as stock. Saddle grafting and budding are also practised. Deep cultivation followed by harrowing is recommended before planting. 

Seeds germinate after about 30 days without any treatment and with up to 80% success rate; they exhibit an epigeal type of germination. The seeds for rootstock are sown in a sandy seedbed about 2 cm apart and at a depth of about 1 cm. After a few months, the seedlings are transplanted into polybags. They grow very slowly; even with nitrogen application rootstocks are not ready for grafting for 2-3 years.
Poison: Seeds contain hydrocyanic acid and should be removed before eating the fruit.
 M. zapota is mainly cultivated for its fruit, which is highly prized and considered one of the best in Central America. It is eaten raw or made into jam, preferably when slightly overripe, and in Cuba and Brazil it is often made into a sherbet. The fruit keeps for about 6 weeks in a refrigerator at around 0 deg. C. The juice may be boiled into syrup or fermented into vinegar.
Apiculture: Honeybees are known to collect nectar from the flowers.
Timber: The valuable wood is homogenous, deep red in colour, very hard, strong, tough, dense, resistant and durable. It is suitable for heavy construction, furniture, joinery and tool handles.
Tannin or dyestuff: Tannin from the bark is used to tan ship sails and fishing tackle.
Medicine: A leaf decoction is taken for fever, haemorrhage, wounds and ulcers; for neuralgia, leaf with tallow is applied as a compress on the temples. Seeds are antipyretic, and when ground with water they act as a diuretic. The plant is a source of sapotin, a glucoside used in medicine as a febrifuge. In Indonesia, the flowers are used as one of the ingredients of a powder that is rubbed on the body of a woman after childbirth. In Cambodia, tannin from the bark is used to cure diarrhoea and fever.
Ornamental: M. zapota is widely cultivated as an ornamental.
Latex or rubber: Wild and cultivated trees in America are tapped for their milky latex, which coagulates into chicle, the principal constituent of chewing gum before the advent of synthetics. In recent years, synthetic substitutes have been replacing chic"
Markhamia lutea,"Local names:
 Amharic (botoro), English (markhamia), Luganda (nsambya,lusambya), Somali (sogdu), Swahili (mtalawanda,mgambo), Trade name (markhamia)
Markhamia lutea is an upright evergreen tree 10-15 m high, with a narrow, irregular crown and long taproot. Bark light brown with fine vertical fissures.

Leaves compound, often in bunches, thin and wavy, each leaflet up to 10 cm, wider at the tip, often with round outgrowths at the base.

Flower buds yellow-green and furry, splitting down 1 side as flower emerges. Flowers bright yellow, in showy terminal clusters, each trumpet shaped, to 6 cm long, with 5 frilly lobes, the throat striped with orange-red.

Fruit very long, thin, brown capsules, to 75 cm in length, hanging in clusters and tending to spiral, splitting on the tree to release abundant seed with transparent wings, 2.5 cm long and yellow-whitish when mature.

The genus was named after Sir Clement Markham, who introduced the famous quinine-yielding cinchona into India. The specific name, ‘lutea’, is Latin for golden-yellow.
Ecology

M. lutea is common in the lake basins and highland areas of eastern Africa. The tree is drought resistant but cannot withstand waterlogging.
Native range
Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda
Tree management

M. lutea grows fast in good forest soil, and plants can attain growth rates of more than 2 m/year. They should be planted in a deep hole, as the roots are long. Trees can be pruned and pollarded to reduce shading and are coppiced when they are about 1.7 m in height. Pods should be collected from the trees after they turn grey.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox, but seeds are better sown fresh. After extraction, seeds can be dried in the sun to 5-10% mc. Mature and properly dried seeds can be stored in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C for several years with no loss in viability. On average, there are about 75 000 seeds/kg.
M. lutea is common in the lake basins and highland areas of eastern Africa. The tree is drought resistant but cannot withstand waterlogging.
Natural regeneration is mainly by seed. Pretreatment is not necessary, and under ideal conditions, seeds germinate within 20-30 days, with an expected rate of 30-60%. Trees may also be propagated by seedling or wildings.
Erosion control: Recommended for use in soil-conservation.
Apiculture: M. lutea provides good bee forage.
Trees are a source of firewood and produce good charcoal. Fuelwood is used to cure tobacco in western Kenya.
Timber: The wood, which is fairly resistant to termites, is used for furniture, poles, posts, tool handles and boat building.
Shade or shelter: The species provides useful shade and acts as a windbreak.

A sun-loving species, it regenerates abundantly in gaps and openings and is often almost gregarious in the transition zone between freshwater swamp and lowland forest.
Pretreatment is not necessary, but because of the very small size of the seeds, they must be sown in seedbeds. Seedlings are pricked out about a month after germination. The species is easy to propagate by cuttings.
  Used in palm soup in Ghana.
Eaten by elephants and other mammals.
Timber:  A commercial timber of West Africa. The wood is yellow and darkens slightly when exposed to light. It is semi-heavy and of medium hardness; its shrinkage and nervosity are average. Because of its good mechanical properties and natural durability, which can be enhanced by preservative treatment, it is sought after as a timber for outdoor uses (harbour works, railway sleepers), buildings (carpentry, floors, facings, indoor and outdoor woodwork) and for cabinet making. The wood is also suitable for fence posts and bridges as it is moderately termite-resistant and resistant to fungi and marine borers. In Ghana, its most popular use is for mortars, but it is also used to make telegraph poles, pit props and mine-shaft guides, furniture and drums.
Shade or shelter: It is a good shade tree and in Uganda was successfully tried and planted by the national Forestry Department.
Medicine: A bark decoction is prescribed for anaemia, stomach-ache and indigestion, as part of an infusion for treating jaundice, bark infusion to treat gonorrhoea; a decoction of leaves is used as a wash for measles."

Fruit a fleshy irregularly shaped globular mass containing many seeds. Each fruit is actually an aggregation of many fruits, each produced from a single flower in the inflorescence. 

Seeds tiny, about 1.5 x 1.0 mm.

The name Nauclea is from the latin naucula meaning a little ship, the specific epithet orientalis is from latin and pertains to the east. The yellow cheesewood can be easily confused with Anthocephalus cadamba.
Ecology

In Australia the yellow cheesewood occurs in a variety of vegetation types from sparse rheophyte shrublands to tall well-developed gallery rainforest where it reaches its best development. Common associates include Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Melaleuca argentea in the drier areas and Castanospermum australe, Beilschmiedia obtusifolia and Syzygium tierneyanum in the wetter areas. In the swampy areas it is often associated with Melaleuca dealbata and Melaleuca leucadendron. Occurs along the major rivers in the interior of the Peninsula, or at least near rivers. Usually N. orientalis is a pioneer species.
Native range
Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand
Tree management

Best grown in medium loam, clay loam and always preferring semi-shaded conditions. Planting results, by direct seeding, best in summer. Natural regeneration of the small-seeded species, orientalis, requires a fairly clean forest/ garden floor for successful germination.

Neobalanocarpus heimii,"Local names:
 Malay (penak,chengal,chengai), Thai (takhian-chantamaeo,takhian-chan,chi-ngamat), Trade name (chengal)
Neobalanocarpus heimii is a large tree, sometimes more than 60 m tall with a diameter of 1 m or more. The bole is straight and branchless for 30 m. The young twigs are lenticellate, resinous, with prominent buttresses. The bark is characteristically dark and scaly, exuding an almost colourless resin. 

Leaves alternate and simple, leathery, elliptical-lanceolate, 7-17 cm long by 2.3-5 cm wide, apex long acuminate. Petioles 5-10 mm long and stipules narrowly oblong, about 12 mm long

Flowers bisexual, broadly ovate, outside caducous puberulent with 5 elliptic, creamy-white or greenish-yellow petals. stamens 15, glabrous; connectives short, curved, slightly exceeding the anthers; ovary ovoid, glabrous with long slender style.

Fruit an acorn-like wingless nut, blanceolate, oblong and cylindrical, 4-5 cm long by 2-2.5 cm wide at the base.  At the time of maturity, the fruits begin to turn from green to brown. During germination the fruit splits into three equal valves when the radicle elongates

Seed shaped like the fruit and a few mm shorter and green at maturity.

N. heimii is closely related to the genus Hopea, whose species have similar leaf characteristics, wood anatomy, biochemistry and habit
Ecology

Chengal is found in mixed dipterocarp tropical lowland forests, especially on undulating lands, in swampy areas and sometimes in dryer areas of swamp forests. In Thailand it occurs in hill dipterocarp forests along slopes and in valleys, often growing with Shorea curtisii. The species ranges from alluvial forests to the foothills and hills of inland forests
Native range
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand
Tree management

The silviculture of chengal is totally dependent on natural regeneration. Regeneration beneath parent trees is rarely abundant in primary rainforests except on ridges of hill forests. Seedlings are capable of surviving for long periods under dense shade but suppressed. They respond to openings of gaps and well-established young trees normally appear without assistance once such openings are created. They respond more positively to such openings than saplings of some Shorea species. Seedlings need shade for development and some success has been achieved with planting in secondary forests. 

There has been some success in enrichment planting trials in advancing secondary forest in Malaysia. Under optimal conditions, the trees attain an estimated diameter of 64 cm in 75 years (very slow growth)
Mature fruits have a high moisture content (over 50%) and should be transported in open or loosely folded bags, allowing ventilation. The bags should not be stacked and should be protected from desiccation and direct sunlight

Seeds exhibit recalcitrant storage behaviour. The seeds are desiccation sensitive and cannot be stored for long. Short-term storage at 14ºC for up to 50 days is possible without serious viability loss

In Thailand it occurs in hill dipterocarp forests along slopes and in valleys, often growing with Shorea curtisii. The species ranges from alluvial forests to the foothills and hills of inland forests
Seeds usually propagate Chengal. Germination is rapid and the germination percentage for fresh seeds is normally very high. The seedlings do not tolerate dense shade, un-shaded conditions or drought and they are often badly damaged by insects. Some shade is required in the early stages, but saplings and later stages benefit from greater amounts of light. Planting in open un-shaded conditions in association with rubber has failed. In Malaysia, planting of chengal in secondary forests has been carried out successfully. It is important that the seedlings are shaded but for further development light is required
Timber: Chengal produces a very durable and heavy timber, with an air-dry density of 915-980 kg/m3.  The sapwood is pale-yellow, heartwood light-brown, darkening on exposure. The wood is moderately lustrous with prominent ripple marks. It is suitable for all forms of heavy construction, particularly boat-building, bridges, railway sleepers, sawn power line posts, heavy flooring, rubber coagulating tanks and many other uses where great strength and durability are required. Like teak, the timber contains preservative compounds that protect the heartwood and even under exposed conditions the timber can last about 100 years. The breaking strength is several times higher than that of oak, both radially and horizontally. The species is over-exploited, has poor regeneration and is in need of in situ conservation especially in Malaysia.
Gum or resin: A good quality resin is produced and known as Dammar penak. "
Nephelium lappaceum,"Local names:
 English (ramboostan,rambutan), Filipino (usan,rambutan), French (litchi chevelu), German (Rambutan), Indonesian (chorogol,rambutan,gente,kakapas), Khmer (saaw maaw,ser mon), Malay (rambutan,buah abong,rangalau), Mandarin (hooun mo daon shau tsz), Swahili
Nephelium lappaceum is an evergreen tree about 10-12 m tall; principal trunk is erect with an open crown of large branches; bark is slightly rugose, greyish or red.

Leaves are alternate, pinnately compound without an end-leaflet. On the lower surface of each leaflet are the domatia, small crater-like hills located in the axils between the mid and secondary veins. The function of the domatia is unknown.

Inflorescence pseudo-terminal to usually terminal; flowers either male (only stamens well developed; trees dioecious) or hermaphrodite (trees monoecious), the latter either effectively female (stamens small, anther not dehiscing) or male (stigma not opening), actinomorphic, whitish, yellowish or greenish; sepals 4-5(7), nearly free to more than halfway connate, 0.7-2.1 mm long; petals usually absent, sometimes up to 4 reduced ones, not exceeding 1.6 mm; disk complete, hairy or glabrous.

Fruit an ellipsoid to subglobular schizocarp, up to 7 x 5 cm, weighing 20-95 g, usually consisting of only 1 nutlet, yellowish to purplish-red, hardly stalked, often finally dehiscing (at least the apical part), glabrous, usually densely set with filiform, curved, 0.5-2 cm long appendages; wall coriaceous, up to 2.5 mm thick. Seed covered by a usually thick, juicy, white to yellow, translucent sarcotesta. 

The specific name stems from the Latin word ‘lappaceus’ meaning ‘bur-like’ and refers to the fruit appendages. The word rambutan is derived from the Malay word ‘hair,’ which describes the numerous, characterizing, long, soft, red or red and green coloured spine-like protuberances (spinterns) on the surface of the fruit.
Ecology

N. lappaceum thrives in humid tropical lowlands within about 17 degrees from the equator. The trees occur in the lower or middle storey in different types of primary and secondary forest ranging from dryland to swamp. Exposure to dry winds leads to browning of the leaf margins; sheltered locations or wind screens are recommended. Low relative humidity and strong wind during fruiting could cause excessive moisture loss from fruit spinterns and result in poor fruit appearance. It is intolerant to frost, especially during the juvenile stage. Mature trees may survive a brief period of temperatures as low as 4 deg. C but with severe defoliation.
Native range
Indonesia, Malaysia
Tree management

Trees should be planted at distances of 10-13 m, with sufficient wind protection. Rambutan trees exhibit strong apical dominance and have a tendency to produce long, upright growth. Early pruning and training to form an open centre tree is recommended. After harvesting, fruited twigs are pruned back to stimulate new growth of up to 4 new side shoots, of which 22% of the shoots will bear fruit in the following season. Dead branches and water suckers should be removed regularly. 
Mulching is essential during establishment and dry periods but should not be applied prior to flowering. For growing trees, a fertilizer rate of 200 g nitrogen, 25 g of phosphate and 100 g potassium per tree per year of age is recommended. For the first 4 years, the fertilizers should be applied in 4 equal dressings, every 3 months. For fruiting trees, 200 g N, 25 g P and 130 g K per tree per year of age is recommended. Maximum fertilizer rate is reached at 12 years, and should remain constant thereafter. For fruiting trees, a quarter of the yearly fertilizer should be applied 4 weeks after fruit set; half the amount should be applied immediately after harvest, and the remaining quarter at 9 weeks after harvesting. Additionally, 0.4 kg of dolomite/tree/year of age, maximum at 10 years and constant after, is applied during slow growing months. At any stage, glyphosate herbicide should not be used near the drip line of rambutan, it could cause a severe yellowing and abscission of the lower leaves. Economic life of a tree is about 15-20 years and may be up to 30 years. Depending on the location, rambutan can produce up to 2 crops a year.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant, whole seed mc at shedding is 36%, viability is reduced by 12% on desiccation from 36% to 25% mc, and no seeds remain viable when the mean mc is reduced to 13%. However excised embryos tolerate desiccation to 14-15% mc, 67% survive desiccation to 8-9% mc; and 40% survive overnight in liquid nitrogen when excised embryos are treated with 10% DMSO plus 3% sucrose followed by partial desiccation (1-2 hours).
N. lappaceum thrives in humid tropical lowlands within about 17 degrees from the equator. The trees occur in the lower or middle storey in different types of primary and secondary forest ranging from dryland to swamp. Exposure to dry winds leads to browning of the leaf margins; sheltered locations or wind screens are recommended. Low relative humidity and strong wind during fruiting could cause excessive moisture loss from fruit spinterns and result in poor fruit appearance. It is intolerant to frost, especially during the juvenile stage. Mature trees may survive a brief period of temperatures as low as 4 deg. C but with severe defoliation.
Rambutan seeds are short-lived and should be sown directly after they are extracted and washed. An effective way to remove flesh that clings tightly to the seeds is by enzyme digestion using a commercially available, non-toxic food grade fungal pectinase enzyme derived from the fungus Aspergillus niger. Add approximately 20 ml enzyme solution into 5 gallons of shelled fruits in water, and let the mixture sit overnight (12 hrs) at room temperature (21-25 deg. C). The seeds should then be rinsed in fresh water before planting or packaging for shipment.
Progeny from seeds are highly variable, so farmers propagate superior forms vegetatively. Well-grown rootstocks are bud grafted at 8-12 months. Dormant buds with well-healed petiole scars from one to two-year-old branches, average 80% success. Rootstock should be cut back 25 cm above the bud union and all foliage removed at 2 weeks after budding. This cutting back and defoliation promotes bud break of the new graft 14-17 days later. Marcotting produces well-rooted propagules, but survival rate is poor. Approach grafting is highly successful, but it is more labour intensive.
Wax:  The seed kernel can be used for the production of rambutan tallow, a solid fat similar to cacao butter, which is used for soap and candles.
Poison:  The fruit wall contains a toxic saponin; cases of poisoning are known.
  The trees are cultivated for their very popular fruit. The usually juicy sarcotesta around the seed is eaten. The sweet-tasting fruits are consumed fresh, the more sour ones are eaten stewed. The sarcotesta can be canned or used in jam, but loses much of its flavour. Seeds are edible when roasted, they are bitter and said to be narcotic. Edible tallow similar to cacao butter, with a high level of arachidic acid, can be rendered from the seeds. The colourful fruits are frequently used in displays with flower and fruit arrangements.
Timber:  The wood of N. lappaceum is liable to splitting during seasoning. It is moderately hard to very hard, strong and tough. The wood is easy to work and can be finished well. It is durable under cover and generally resistant to insect attacks, but susceptible to fungal attacks. The reddish coloured rambutan wood is usually too small to be valued as timber. The average fibre length of wood is 1.07 mm.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Young shoots are used to produce a green colour on silk that is first dyed yellow with turmeric. The fruit walls are used, together with tannin-rich parts of other plants, to dye silk black after a preliminary red staining. Leaves are used, together with mud, as an impermanent black dye.
Lipids:  Seeds contain an oil formerly used for illumination and a fat used formerly for soap.
Medicine:  Fruit is said to be astringent, stomachic, and anthelmintic; the leaves are used in poultices for headaches. In Java the toxic saponin is dried and used as medicine. In Malaysia, the roots are used in a decoction for treating fever; and the bark as an astringent for tongue diseases.
Ornamental:  Rambutan is beautiful, especially when in full fruit, making it a popular ornamental tree for backyards and public streets.
Intercropping:  The planting of cash crops or green manure crops among young trees can be beneficial, but crops should not be planted too near to the trees. Legumes with low growth habits such as Canavalia, Crotalaria and Vigna can also be intercropped with rambutan."

Newtonia buchananii,"Local names:
 English (newtonia,forest newtonia), Luganda (mpewere), Swahili (mnyasa), Trade name (mufomoti)
Newtonia buchananii is a tall deciduous tree 10-40 m high, with a rather flat crown. The tree trunk is often short but can be extremely high in forest valleys, with strongly fluted buttresses. Bark is smooth and light grey. Branchlets with rust-brown hairs.

Leaves bipinnate, leaflets numerous (24-)38-67 pairs, linear or falcate 2-9 mm long, tiny and light green when young. Leaf rachis with a stipitate tiny gland between each pinna-pair.

Inflorescences in erect cream spikes fading to brown, 3-18 cm long. Flowers sessile or nearly so, anthers with an apical gland that soon falls off, ovary densely pilose outside.

Pods brown, 1.3-2.5 cm, thin 15-30 cm long, splitting open on one side. Seeds lying longitudinally in the pod, seeds flat, distinctive red-brown, to 4-7 cm long, 1-2 cm wide, surrounded by a membranous wing.

The generic and specific epithets are honorary for Sir Isaac Newton, the famous English scientist, and Buchanan, a botanical collector and Vice Consul in Malawi from 1877-1890.
Ecology

N. buchananii is common in lowland and upland rain forest, usually near streams, ground water, or as a component of riverine, mist or swamp forest.
Native range
Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

N. buchananii is a fairly fast growing tree once established, but needs care during the establishment phase.
Germination percentage rates are up to 90% in 20-30 days. There are 3 000-13 000 seeds/ kg. No pretreatment is necessary. However the seeds remain viable for only a few weeks at room temperature storage. Pods should be collected from the tree crown immediately they turn brown, then dried before seed extraction. Direct sowing does not appear to be a suitable method for regenerating N. buchananii: survival (26%) and growth were slow in trials at Amani, Tanzania.

Ocimum gratissimum,"Local names:
 English (wild basil,tree basil,East Indian basil,clove basil), French (menthe gabonaise), Indonesian (ruku-ruku rimba), Malay (ruku-ruku hitam), Thai (horapha-chang), Vietnamese ([es] l[as] l[ows]n)
Ocimum gratissimum is an aromatic, perennial herb, 1-3 m tall; stem erect, round-quadrangular, much branched, glabrous or pubescent, woody at the base, often with epidermis peeling in strips. 

Leaves opposite; petiole 2-4.5 cm long, slender, pubescent; blade elliptical to ovate, 1.5-16 cm x 1-8.5 cm, membranaceous, sometimes glandular punctate, base cuneate, entire, margin elsewhere coarsely crenate-serrate, apex acute, puberulent or pubescent. 

Inflorescence a verticillaster, arranged in a terminal, simple or branched raceme 5-30 cm long; rachis lax, softly pubescent; bracts sessile, ovate, 3-12 mm x 1-7 mm, acuminate, caducous; pedicel 1-4 mm long, spreading or ascending, slightly curved; flowers in 6-10-flowered verticillasters, small, hermaphrodite; calyx 2-lipped, 2-3 mm long, in fruit 5-6 mm, pubescent, upper lip rounded and recurved, reflexed in fruit, lower lip with 4, narrow, pointed teeth, central pair of teeth minute and much shorter than the upper lip; corolla campanulate, 3.5-5 mm long, 2-lipped, greenish-white, pubescent outside, upper lip truncate, 4-fid, lower lip longer, declinate, flat, entire; stamens 4, declinate, in 2 pairs, inserted on the corolla tube, filaments distinctly exserted, upper pair with a bearded tooth at the base; ovary superior, consisting of 2 carpels, each 2-celled, style 2-fid. 

Fruit consisting of 4, dry, 1-seeded nutlets enclosed in the persistent calyx (the lower lip closing the mouth of the fruiting calyx); nutlet subglobose, 1.5 mm long, rugose, brown; outer pericarp not becoming mucilaginous in water.

O. gratissimum is a variable polymorphic complex species, often subdivided into subspecies, varieties and formas, mainly based on differences in chemical content, the morphology of the fruiting calyx, and on different degrees of hairiness, but the variation forms a continuum. Sometimes O. gratissimum (existing chromosome counts: 2n = 40, 48, 64), O. suave (2n = 32, 48, 64) and O. viride (2n = 38, 40) (here treated as one complex species O. gratissimum) are considered as three different species. Although more research is needed it seems certain that those three taxa are closely related and have 10 homologous chromosomes in common. Crosses between O. gratissimum and O. viride resulted in partially fertile F1 hybrids. Variability is greatest in Africa and India. In Java, 2 chemotypes exist, the eugenol and the thymol type, respectively described as O. gratissimum L. forma caryophyllatum Backer and forma graveolens Backer. Forma caryophyllatum is characterized by: leaves clove-scented when bruised, upper side short-haired, lower side densely gland-dotted, bracts 4-6 mm long, much longer than wide, lower lip of corolla not flushed with violet; and forma graveolens by: leaves strongly odoriferous but not clove-scented when bruised, upper surface covered with minute hairs, bracts 2-4 mm long, about as long as wide, lower lip of corolla flushed violet inside. Most Ocimum species contain essential oil but are primarily used as vegetable (e.g. hoary basil, O. americanum L.), as spice (e.g. sweet basil, O. basilicum L.), or as vegetable and medicine (e.g. sacred or holy basil, O. tenuiflorum L.).
Ecology

In its native area O. gratissimum occurs from sea-level up to 1500 m altitude in coastal scrub, along lake shores, in savanna vegetation, in submontane forest, and disturbed land. In South-East Asia it is not frequently found in open locations like roadsides and clearings, but more often cultivated as a hedge plant, up to about 300 m altitude.
Native range
Tree management

The time for transplanting seedlings into the field in the delta of the Hong River in northern Vietnam is February-March, in southern Vietnam from May-August. Plants are spaced at about 40 cm x 50 cm. The optimum harvesting time for distillation of the essential oil is when 3 branches per plant or 75% of the branches are flowering. In northern Vietnam 2-3 cuts can be obtained in an average year, 4-5 cuts per year in the south. In Vietnam, O. gratissimum remains productive for 5-10 years.

In India, yields of 70-75 t/ha green herbage of O. gratissimum producing 400 l essential oil in 2 years have been obtained experimentally. In Thailand harvesting every 10-12 days resulted in an annual green herbage yield of only 13 t/ha and an oil yield of nearly 200 l.

Ecology

O. usambarensis is found in diverse mountain forest associations, the so-called ocotea forest. The tree is distributed throughout East Africa and common in wetter forests. Where it occurs naturally, there is a distinct dry season of 2-3 months, but with mist or clouds present throughout the year. It is found mainly in Kenya and Tanzania and sparsely in Uganda. In Kenya, it occurs on the moist slopes of the Aberdares, Mt Kenya, Taita Hills and Nyambene; it was once a dominant tree in the wet forests of these areas but is now rare everywhere. In Uganda, it occurs in upland and mountain forests, commonly in the Impenetrable (Bwindi), Kalinzu and Kasyoha-Kitomi Forests. In Tanzania, it occurs on Mt Kilimanjaro, the Usambara, Pare and Uluguru Mountains, and in Tukuyu and Iringa.

Tree management

O. usambarensis is fast-growing and responds well to coppicing.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant, but seed can be stored in containers with moist sawdust for a few days. On average, there are 15 000-20 000 seeds/kg.
O. usambarensis is found in diverse mountain forest associations, the so-called ocotea forest. The tree is distributed throughout East Africa and common in wetter forests.

In Tanzania, it occurs on Mt Kilimanjaro, the Usambara, Pare and Uluguru Mountains, and in Tukuyu and Iringa.
Seeds are sensitive to desiccation and should be sown fresh. Pretreatment is not necessary; under ideal conditions, seeds germinate in 30-45 days, and the expected germination rate of mature, healthy and properly handled seeds is 45%. Regeneration by root suckers is also possible, as stumps sucker easily.
O. usambarensis is a good source of firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  The heartwood is light yellowish-brown, darkening to a deep brown on exposure; sapwood slightly paler, not clearly demarcated. The texture is medium to fine and even; grain interlocked producing a stripe figure; sometimes lustrous; timber has a distinct camphor scent. The wood seasons well and is resistant to acids and fungi but not to termites. It can be used for furniture, railway-coach frames, joinery, panelling, building poles and the production of veneer.
Medicine:  Bark or roots are pounded, water added and the resulting paste applied on swellings such as those on the throat and other tumours. Inner bark may be pounded, mixed with Brucea spp and Myrica salicifolia and taken in a meat soup as a remedy for abscess, whooping cough and measles. In Kenya, the Taita people boil the bark in water and use it to treat a fatal childhood disease called ‘nyago’ characterized by strong muscular contractions, stomach pains and disturbed breathing, or it may be scraped and the resulting powder used to dress wounds. Malaria and backache are treated using juice obtained from roots that have been pounded and soaked in water."
Olea capensis,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (ysterhout), English (ironwood olive,ironwood,Elgon olive,East African olive,black ironwood), Swahili (mushargi,loliondo), Trade name (olive,mutharagi,mutharage,loliondo)
Olea capensis is often a bushy shrub or a small to medium sized tree up to 10 m in height, but it may be much larger, occasionally reaching 40 m; occurring in bush, littoral scrub and evergreen forest. Bark: light grey, becoming dark grey and vertically fissured with age; a characteristic blackish gum is exuded from bark wounds. 

Leaves lanceolate-oblong to almost circular, 3-10 x 1.5-5 cm, light to dark green and glossy above, rather paler green below, although sometimes almost unicoloured, occasionally purplish-tinged, without hairs or scales; apex broadly tapering to almost rounded; base tapering; margin entire, thickened and often very wavy; petiole often purplish, 0.3-1.7 cm long.

The flowers are small, white or cream, sweetly scented, in many flowered axillary or terminal heads, 3-15 cm long. 

Fruit ovoid, fleshy, up to 2 x 1 cm, when ripe they are somewhat succulent purplish drupes. 

This species has been divided into 3 subspecies: ssp. macrocarpa, fruits oblong to elliptic, up to 2 x 1 cm; flowers in lax heads. Ssp. capensis, fruits almost spherical to oblong elliptic, up to 1 cm long; flowers in dense heads and leaves very variable, apex often rounded; branchlets grey to greyish-brown. Ssp. enervis, leaves usually broadly elliptic, apex tapering; branchlets grey to whitish.
Ecology

O. capensis occurs almost throughout Africa south of the Sahara desert from Sudan and Ethiopia to the southern extremity of the continent and west to the Islands of the Gulf of Guinea and to Sierra Leone. A species of situations where temperatures are relatively low and, apart from diurnal fluctuations, fairly constant temperatures throughout the year. In East Africa, the elevations where the tree naturally grows provide these conditions, and further south in the range it occurs at lower elevations but at these latitudes temperatures are also lower. O. capensis ssp. macrocarpa is well known in its indigenous range of southern Africa.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Sao Tome et Principe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Growth is reported fast in young plants but much slower in older ones. Over the first 4 years a mean annual height of 1.1 m has been reported. It is a shade-tolerant, pioneer species and a dominant forest tree. Protected from uncontrolled harvesting in Tanzania.
Seed storage behaviour appears to be orthodox. Storage of the seed is not advisable without refrigeration facilities: if these are available a low temperature 3 deg. C should be used. There are 3 000-3 300 seeds/kg.

O. capensis is usually raised from seeds. Seed is collected and cleaned of all pulp, soaking in water for 2 days makes removal easier. Dormancy is a major problem. Fresh, mature, healthy seed germinate reasonably. Germination percentage tends to be low (30-40%) and uneven (usually extended over 2-3 months but even occurring as late as 2 years after sowing).
O. capensis is a useful fodder tree.
A viable species for fuelwood from which excellent charcoal can be made.
Timber:  The wood of ssp. capensis and ssp. enervis is rarely used, but that of ssp. macrocarpa makes a fine, high quality timber. It has dark brown heartwood and is attractively figured, fine-grained, hard and heavy and although it is difficult to work it has been widely used in railway sleepers, wagon woods, bridge construction and for flooring blocks.

Olea europaea ssp. africana,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (olyfboom,olienhout,swartolienhout), Amharic (weira), Arabic (zeitun bari), English (brown olive,wild olive,Indian olive,African wild olive,olive), German (Ölbaum), Hindi (bair banj,zaitoon,kan,kau,kahu,kao), Ndebele (umnquma), Shona (mupfungo)
Olea europaea ssp. africana is a shrub or a small to medium sized tree 5-10 m in height, occasionally reaching 18 m. Bark is grey to brownish-blackish, smooth to rough when old.

Leaves narrowly oblong-elliptic, 2-10 cm x 7-17 mm, grey-green to shiny dark green above, greyish or yellowish with a dense covering of silvery, golden or brown scales on the under surface; apex and base narrowly tapering, apex sharp tipped; margin entire, rolled under and curved back from the midrib, petiole slender, up to 10 mm long, so the leaves tend to droop. 

Flowers greenish-white or cream, 6-10 mm long, sweetly scented, in loose axillary or occasionally terminal heads, 5-6 cm long. 

Fruit ovoid, thinly fleshy, about 10 x 8 mm tapering to a sharp tip, dark brown or black when mature. 

Ssp. africana (Mill.) P.S. Green is the only subspecies that occurs south of the Zambezi River.
Ecology

O. europea ssp africana is widely distributed in its native range of southern Africa occurring in a variety of habitats, usually near water, on stream banks, in riverine fringes, but also in open woodland, among rocks and in mountain ravines. It is resistant to both frost and drought. Dry upland evergreen forest (edges, remnants) often associated with Juniperus; may be co dominant; also in woodland on lava flows.
Native range
China, Eritrea, Ethiopia, France, India, Italy, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Unfertilized seedlings show drought tolerance whilst fertilized seedlings do not. Fertilization with adequate watering results in greatly increased shoot growth but little change in root growth. In summary, plants need adequate nutrition and water to grow, and irrigation or fertilizing plants usually increases their growth where water or nutrients are deficient. Fertilization and irrigation need to be carefully managed to ensure optimal growth is consistent with post-transplant survival.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3 deg. C with 6-10% mc. The seeds can be stored at dry room temperature for a few years. There are approximately 13 800 seeds/kg.

It is resistant to both frost and drought. Dry upland evergreen forest (edges, remnants) often associated with Juniperus; may be co dominant; also in woodland on lava flows.
Local attempts in Eritrea to reforest this species have been unsuccessful due to seed germination ranging from 0-5%. A large increase in germination is obtained by removing the endocarp; it imposes a mechanical constraint to germination not a chemical one. Cracking with a hand vice or by rolling a stone over seeds can cause the endocarp to break along or across the suture line, which bisects it. By removing the endocarp germination is greatly enhanced, reaching up to 92% in seed stored for 18 months. Low temperature stratification does not appear to be necessary. Seedlings should not be outplanted shortly after being fertilized.
Cuttings root fairly easily. Rooting and the growth of new leaves are strongly influenced by the nutrient status of parent plants and the application of rooting hormone to the base of cuttings.
The high drought tolerance of O. europaea ssp. africana suggests that it is a good candidate for reforestation in semi-arid zones of Africa such as Rora Habab, Eritrea.
  The main olive products are olive oil and edible olives. The fleshy, oil-bearing mesocarp used in commercial olive growing is absent in the much smaller fruits of O. europaea ssp. africana.
The plants are much browsed on by livestock.
In Eritrea the villagers use wild olive extensively to provide fuelwood.
Timber:  Wood is hard and heavy, weighing approximately 1 140 kg/cubic m. Sapwood is light brown while the heartwood is red-brown to yellow, with dark figuring. The wood is fine-textured and finishes well, and is often used to make ornaments such as wall clocks and vases. Jewellery items such as beads, brooches and bangles are also made from wild olive wood. Although the tree does not produce sawable logs or branches, there are still several furniture-makers that, with great effort produce furniture from the limited quantities of timber.
Medicine:  The Wandorobo and Kipsigis of Kenya use a root or bark decoction as a remedy for malaria.
Ornamental:  Olive plantations have the capacity to beautify the landscape."
Olneya tesota,"Local names:
 English (tesota,desert ironwood)
Olneya tesota is a conspicuous small tree up to 10 m in height, commonly with several trunks. The trunks can attain a diameter up to 60 cm on very old individuals. Young twigs up to 10 or 15 mm thick, green. Bark grey and smooth, fissured and shredding on older trunks. Sharp, paired spines, 3-11 mm long at nodes. 

Leaves simple, pinnately compound up to 6-cm long; leaflets 6-20 greyish-green in colour, 7-20 mm long.  Ten or fewer pairs of leaflets to 1 cm long; spines at base of leaves, paired, slightly curved, 0.6 cm long, and usually brown-tipped. Foliage evergreen to semi-deciduous.

Flowers pink to lavender, papilionaceous; 15 mm long, appearing in short, dense racemes or panicles in late spring.

Mature pods dehiscent, several seeded.

Seeds 5-6 mm in diameter.

The genus Olneya is monospecific and can be easily mistaken for Palo Verde (Cercidium spp.) but has a greyer color and lacks the distinctive yellow flowers in spring.
Ecology

O. tesota is a dominant component of many plant communities. It is usually restricted to dry desert watercourses, sandy and rocky soils of plains, slopes and along dry washes, where storm runoff increases the available moisture. The largest individuals are found in these habitats, often forming woodlands with other desert trees including Cercidium floridum, Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana, P. velutina, Acacia greggii, and others. O. tesota is endemic to the Sonoran Desert Region, Mexico. It is found in central and southwest Arizona and southeast California, USA, much of the Baia California peninsula, western Sonoran and extreme northwest Sinaloa, Mexico. O. tesota is adapted to hot climates, tolerates some freezing but generally sustains stem damage below -60 deg C. Prolonged exposure to lower temperatures may cause severe damage or death. It tolerates summer temperatures of 45 deg C. Because of its preference for warmer sites, O. tesota has been used as an indicator plant in choosing locations for citrus plantations.
Native range
Mexico, United States of America
Tree management

Young plants may be severely damaged by browsing, particularly by rodents. No significant disease problems have been reported. The plants do not appear to be fire resistant. The spiny stems can be a nuisance to people working around the plants, young trees should not be planted near pathways. The trees are long-lived attaining up to 200 years of age. The trees do not respond well to coppicing. Larger trees are usually killed by this practice and recovery of younger plants is slow. O. tesota grows slowly, prolonging the time it takes for the tree to reach flowering size. Typically slow growing in the wild, established plants can grow up to 60 cm per year under favourable conditions in cultivation. O. tesota shows no tendency to become weedy. The foliage is cold and drought deciduous but trees in favorable locations may remain nearly evergreen.
Scarification of the seeds enhances uniform germination but fresh seeds will germinate without scarification. Optimum temperature for germination appears to be 25-30 deg C. Fresh seeds often have 80-90% germination. Emergence usually occurs in 4-12 days.

Picked pods should be dried for several days to facilitate seed extraction. Fresh seeds require no pre-treatment, although 12 to 24 hour soak may be helpful. Stored seeds should be soaked for at least 24 hours. Mild scarification before soaking may also be required. Seedlings can be started in flats and transplanted to containers. Germination is prompt. Seedlings can reach 25 cm tall in their first season.
Poison:  The seeds contain canavalin, a mild toxin.
Erosion control:  The tree is useful for soil conservation.
  Fresh, uncooked seeds have a taste similar to soybeans. The native Seri Indians of Sonora, Mexico, cooked the seeds in water, emptied the water and then cooked the seeds a second time in fresh water to remove an unpleasant smell. The cooked seeds are eaten whole, or ground and salted. Roasted seeds have been used as a substitute for coffee.
Wildlife and domestic livestock browse the foliage to some extent.
O. tesota is cut for fuelwood and charcoal production, widespread cutting of O. tesota has seriously reduced the numbers of these trees in areas of Mexico.
Timber:  The wood is very hard, one of the heaviest in the world, dense and durable. It will not float in water. The wood is used for gift items, pens and carvings. The heartwood is dark brown and takes a beautiful polish. 
Shade or shelter:  Tesota makes an excellent shade tree with its multi-trunked stem and low-branches.
Nitrogen fixing:  O. tesota seedlings grown in nitrogen free media produced nodules when inoculated with soil taken from beneath wild trees. Nodulation has been reported from cultivated trees in Zimbabwe.
Ornamental:  O. tesota is cultivated as a landscape tree in hot arid regions of southwestern United States. The nearly evergreen foliage, dense shade, showy flowers and attractive form make it well suited for a variety of landscape functions. 
The desert ironwood is also used as a screen plant.
Intercropping:  Other desert plants, including shrubs, vines, cacti, and annuals, often grow in the microclimate beneath the canopy of O. tesota"
Opuntia ficus-indica,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (boer(e) turksvy,doringblaar,grootdoringturksvy,kaalblaar), Arabic (beles), English (Indian pricklypear,Indian fig,mission prickly pear,prickly pear,Spanish tuna), French (Indischer Feigenkaktus,Figuier d'Inde), Italian (Pero pungente,eico d'In
Opuntia ficus-indica is a shrub or tree up to 5 m tall, forming sturdy trunk with age. Joints flattened, narrowly elliptic to ovate, varying in size, 30-60 cm long and 6-12 cm broad, attenuate below, often acute above, fairly thick, glaucous-green; areoles small to large, raised and woolly, with 3-6 radiating, unequally long, greyish white spines up to 3 (-10) cm long, straight or occasionally slightly curved, or spineless (in older plants and some cultivars).

Leaves, if developed, are minute, subulate and early deciduous.

Flowers about 7 cm long; hypanthium broadly cylindrical, contracted below, with numerous raised areoles spirally arranged, densely wooly and filled with glochidia, occasionally also bearing small spines and minute leaves; petaloid segments yellow or orange.

Fruits ellipsoid, about 7 cm long, reddish, succulent, edible.

Seeds about 5 mm long.

There is a distinction between the spiny naturalized pears, which are invasive weeds and the cultivated, spine-less ones. The latter exits in several cultivars eg. O. ficus-indica forma inermis O. ficus-indica forma amyclaea and O. ficus-indica forma elongata.
Ecology

Pricky pears are generally not confined to deserts. Many grow in grasslands, woodlands and some in moist tropical forests. O. ficus-indica in particular is native to sub-tropical uplands. The development of O. ficus-indica is restricted in the Mediterranean basin by the winter cold temperatures. The spiny, naturalized pear is recorded as a pest in part of South Africa and Australia.
Native range
Mexico
Tree management

Plantations are established at different levels according to the utilization and local conditions. In traditional fruit production operations, plants are established quite densely, with some 5 000 or more individual plants/ha. Fodder planting is governed by the conditions under which the exploitation, harvesting and transportation is done: 3 000-5 000 plants/ha is common. Modern plantations, under mechanized cultivation, harvesting and transportation to the site of consumption by tractor and trailer, are planted at a density of 1 000-2 000 plants/ha, with a spacing of 5-7 m between the rows and 1-2 m along the rows.

Maintenance and weeding are done by 2-4 shallow disk plowings per year in the fall and spring, with or without the inclusion of manure.

Plantations are exploitable after 4-5 years and fully grown after 7-10 years; when well managed, some are known to have remained productive for more than 50 years. Irrigation calls for some precautions, direct contact of the aerial parts of the plants with water must be avoided in order to prevent cryptogamic and bacterial diseases.

By pruning and grazing, the plants are encouraged to develop trunks up to 3 m high and are then left to branch freely, in time forming a dense canopy 4-5 m high.
Pricky pears are generally not confined to deserts. Many grow in grasslands, woodlands and some in moist tropical forests. O. ficus-indica in particular is native to sub-tropical uplands. The development of O. ficus-indica is restricted in the Mediterranean basin by the winter cold temperatures. The spiny, naturalized pear is recorded as a pest in part of South Africa and Australia.
It is easily cultivated through vegetative propagation from segments. Before propagation, the segments should be exposed to diffuse sunlight for 7-15 days, to partially wither them. This process improves rooting. The segments are then planted in rows. They require slight watering and occasional hoeing, during dry weather.
Planting shrubs and particularly cacti is one of the easiest to rehabilitate degraded landscapes. Cacti, because of their easy establishment by vegetative propagation, are amenable to the rehabilitation of lands that could not be reclaimed through conventional agricultural methods because of their steep slope and other physical factor limitations. In Tunisia and Algeria for instance, stony and rocky slope have been rehabilitated by planting cacti on contours.
Erosion control: Cactus hedges play a major role in erosion control and land-slope partitioning particularly when established along contours. The hedge is a physical obstacle to runoff, favoring temporary local runoff accumulation and silting, thus preventing regressive erosion. In arid lands subject to wind erosion, cactus hedges are an easy, cheap and efficient way of prevention and control of top soil loss and accumulation of wind-borne deposits.
  The pricky pear fruit ranges in flavour from sour to very sweet. The fruit, known as tuna in spanish and sabra in arabic, is eaten throughout Latin America, the Mediterranean and the middle east. There is commercial tuna production in Italy, Spain, Sicily, Tunisia, Mexico and south America, especially Chile. The tender young pads (Nopalitos) are eaten as a vegetable particularly during the lent season.
With decline in demand for the tender young pads at the end of the lent, they are alternatively used as dairy cattle fodder. Local dairymen maintain that cactus pads are essential for good lactation, imparts a better flavour and quality to the milk and enhances better quality for butter. The most extensive use of cactus occurs in Brazil where O. ficus-indica has been grown as a fodder for more than 80 years.
The thorny varieties of O. ficus-indica such as forma amyclaea and forma elongata are often used as defensive hedges for the protection of gardens, orchards and olive groves through out North America and in parts of Italy
Soil improver:  Cacti help in maintaining soil fertility via their geobiogene and trace element cycling activities, enriching the top soil in organic matter and improving its structure and the stability of its aggregates, hence permeability and water uptake balance.
Other services:  The cactus hedges when established in double rows, play an important part in landscape organization, and in the local socio-economy, as evidence of land rights and land ownership in countries or regions where no land registry exists"
Orbignya phalerata,"Local names:
 English (babassu palm,American oil palm), Portuguese (coco de macau,bagassú,babaçú,aguassú), Spanish (shapaja,catirina,babasú)
Babassu palm is an androdioecious palm tree, with a straight, single and cylindrical trunk to 30 m high and a diameter of 20-45 cm.

Leaves numerous, green yellowish, erect, pinnate, spreading to drooping, 5-10 m long, doubled downwards in the young apex; leaf stalks short with a broad base.

Inflorescences large. Male and female inflorescences occur on the same plant, sometimes on a single inforescence. Inflorescences arise among the leaf bases in large, 0.5-1.8 m long, very dense clusters, with innumerable small flowers.

The fruits of babassu palm look like small coconuts, born in clusters of a few dozen to several hundred. Some trees can yield up to one-half ton of fruits per year.
 Each bunch of fruits, weighing 15-90 Kg, contains 200-600 fruits. Each Fruit elliptic to oblong; 6-12 x 4-10 cm, 40-440 g in dry weight.  Epicarp fibrous 1-4 mm thick; endocarp ligneous, 35-75 mm diameter, containing 3-6 oval to elliptical seeds (rarely one to two or more than six), each one of 3 to 6 cm in length, with endosperm oily and white. Mesocarps dry, 2-12 mm thick.
Ecology

This palm is best suited to a humid climate and is found in rainforest regions and 
throughout its distribution range, it forms the dominant vegetal cover over millions of hectares of forest.
Native range
Brazil, Guyana, Mexico, Peru
Tree management

 Babassu fruit sprouts through a process of cryptogeal germination, so that damaged seedlings and juveniles later resprout. Moreover, babassu juveniles (pindovas) can remain in the forest understorey for as long as 50 years, ultimately yielding an accumulation of up to 6000 plants/ha. (Louis, 2000)

Babasú requires a tropical climate, high temperatures, plenty of sunshine, fertile soils and an adequate water supply. In a primary forest, it requires seven years to produce the first compound leaf and 42 years for other leaves. When cultivated without shade and in more favorable conditions, the plants take 10 years to mature.
Seed storage behaviour is intermediate. Storage temperatures of 50C are said to damage seed viability in moist storage.
This palm is best suited to a humid climate and is found in rainforest regions and 
throughout its distribution range, it forms the dominant vegetal cover over millions of hectares of forest.
Babassu palm is normally seed propagated. It is very difficult to obtain reliable levels of germination in the field. The eating away of mesocarp by rodents stimulates seed germination, a process that takes up to 3 months normally. In the field, seed dormancy can also be broken though fires and shade. 

Laboratory seed pre-treatment involves the removal of seeds endocarp, followed by a 30 minutes treatment with a 0.3% Benomyl solution.
The babassu palm has great potential for reforestation of degraded tropical ecosystems. Although it is somewhat slow going, taking 15 to 20 years to mature, once established in an area it is an extremely aggressive component of the ecosystem. As such, it could be introduced into many degraded sites, providing support for the soil, food and shade to the local animal population, and products to the humans.
 The pulp and seed are eaten fresh. The extracted oil from the nut is similar to coconut or oil palm, with low yield, for the oil industry. Refined oil is used for margarine production and general food purposes. The grounded mesocarp or pulp is a source of starch for producing alcohol. The terminal bud is edible, but more often it is tapped, in lieu of the inflorescence for its multiple purpose sap.  The larvae of the bruchid beetle (Pachymerus nuclearum and Carybruchus lipismatus). This beetle is a natural predator of the fruit and its larvae enter the fruit through its germination pores, usually after abcission. The larvae grow and develop within the fruit's seed chambers, assimilating oil and protein. Regional peasants eat the larvae (tapu'a), which are extracted in the same manner as kernels, by cracking open the fruit and picking them out of the chambers. Grubs are usually stir-fried with manioc flour, and taste a bit like bacon.
Fodder: Tender leaves around the bud are used as forage. The fruit mesocarp is a source of starch for animal feeds. The protein of nut contains 2.3 % of methionine and 4.3 % of lysin. After the oil is extracted, the cakes, which contain 1.1 % of phosphorus and 0.43 % of magnesium, are used as animal feeds.
The endocarp is used to make an excellent charcoal. The dry fruit is made up of 11-14% outer shell, 14-25% mesocarp, 50-67% woody inner shell and 61% kernels. This charcoal is being increasingly sold to national and foreign buyers as industrial fuel. Husks are sometimes used to smoke rubber. The crude oil from the seeds is used for lighting lamps.
Fibre: The leaves are used for roofing and fibers for basketry, tapestry and nets.
Timber: The old trunks are useful for bridges and building as well as cellulose and paper.
Lipids: The fruit contains 3-8 kernels with oil content of 60-70% while the outer fibrous portion of the fruit contains only about 1% oil. This colourless oil is somewhat similar to coconut oil as does not readily become rancid. The crude oil is suitable for soap production and detergents. 
Alcohol: Alcohol tar can be derived through industrial processing.
Other services: Naturally growing forests are recycling nutrient supporting other forms of agriculture"
Osyris compressa,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (pruimbos,pruimbas), English (msandali,coastal tannin bush,Cape sumach,Bark Bosch,African sandalwood), Xhosa (umbalanythi,mtekaaza,inTekeza), Zulu (umbulanyathi,mbulunyathi,inTshakasa,inGondotha-mpethe)
Osyris compressa is a fast growing shrub to a small bushy tree of 1–5 m in height. It is a partial parasite (hemiparasitic) on the roots of other plants with a smooth greyish bark.

Leaves evergreen, opposite, elliptical, tough, leathery, erect and crowded up the stem; 10–50 x 10–27 mm, and blue-green with a grey bloom.

Flowers small, about 2 mm across, yellowish green, slightly scented, inconspicuous, borne in small terminal heads or panicles. 

Fruits ellipsoid (elliptic in long section and circular in cross section), fleshy, about 15 x 10 mm, becoming bright, shiny red and then purplish black. 

The generic name is from the Greek ozos and means branched, referring to the branching habit of the plant. The specific ephithet compressa means laterally flattened. The tree is closely related to an inland species namely Osyris quadripartita ( Transvaal sumach), previously known as O. lanceolata but the latter can easily be recognized by the alternate leaves and the axillary flowers.
Ecology

Osyris compressa occurs on coastal dunes and lower mountain slopes as well as savanna habitats and are very tolerant of windy conditions. It thrives in sandy conditions and grows with other species of the genera Rhus, Coleonema, Maytenus, Leucadendron, Metalasia and Chrysanthemoides.
Native range
Australia, India, Kenya, Lesotho, South Africa
Osyris compressa occurs on coastal dunes and lower mountain slopes as well as savanna habitats and are very tolerant of windy conditions. It thrives in sandy conditions and grows with other species of the genera Rhus, Coleonema, Maytenus, Leucadendron, Metalasia and Chrysanthemoides.
The primary mode of propagation is by seeds which fall to the ground and grow together with other plants to serve as hosts.  It has not been possible to grow from cuttings.
Erosion control:  Plants thrive in sandy conditions and together with other species of plants forms an important soil stabilizer in coastal dune systems.
  The fruits are edible and were an important food of the early inhabitants of the South African Cape. The fleshy part could also be compressed and stored for lean times. The bark when boiled produces a dark coloured solution which was used to flavour tea.
The wood has also been utilized as firewood.
Timber:  The wood is heavy and fine-grained, suitable for curving ornaments and small utensils like pestles.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The fresh leaves of Osyris compressa were used to tan leather a light brown colour, while the bark was used to tan leather dark brown. A decoction of fresh leaves was used to tan cotton, fishing lines and nets to make them more durable in the days before nylon.
Medicine: A boiled concoction of the bark together with other herbs is reputed to be useful in improving blood circulation, digestive, respiratory and nervous systems. The boiled product is given to women after giving birth to boost their appetite. The oils and paste derived from the bark is used to treat skin diseases such as infectious sores, ulcers, acne and rashes. The tree is also known to be disinfectant and a sedative.  It is reputed to be effective against the killer hepatitis B. 
Ornamental:  The fruits are highly decorative on the plant. Fruits don't ripen all at once hence the plant can be very attractive for long periods throughout the year. They also attract birds and insects to the garden, wherever planted.
Boundary or barrier:  Cape sumach is recommended as a seaside subject and plants form very effective small windbreaks provided there are enough host plants.
Essential oils:  The bark, stem, seeds and roots are used in the manufacture of aromatic oils that are used in making expensive perfumes, quality lotions, rare soaps and sweet-smelling candles. The wood yields between four and 10 per cent oil when distill"
Osyris lanceolata,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (rotslooibas,pruimbos,looibas,bergbas), Catalan (arraià. Ginestó valencià), English (Transvaal sumach,rock tannin-bush,East African sandalwood,bark bush), Spanish (bayón), Xhosa (intshakasa,intekeza,ingondotha-mpete), Zulu (umbulunyathi)
Osyris lanceolata is a large, slender  hardy shrub or a small tree (7-10 m tall). This multi-stemmed, evergreen hemi-parasitic plant has a round to irregular canopy and a grey smooth bark (later thick and rough). 

Leaves sparse, blue-green, simple, alternate, lanceolate, sometimes egg-shaped, slightly glaucous, thick in texture, smooth with a waxy bloom, crowded along the stems; the apex is broadly tapering to rounded with a fine, sharp tip.  The base is broadly tapering; lamina 2.5-7.5 cm, entire and rolled; petiole short, winged up to 0.6 cm, attachment to the stem forming ridges running down the stem.  Twigs and leaves point upwards.

Flowers small, unisexual, yellow-green, becoming red when ripe; borne in leaf axils in short panicles or clusters of 2-3 flowers.  Male flowers in axillary cymes, female solitary; all floral parts in fours.

Fruit small, edible, 1-seeded drupe, about 1 cm long, fleshy, egg-shaped, and green at first, turning yellow and becoming bright red to purple-black when ripe; crowned with a persistent calyx.
Ecology

Normally found in mountain slopes, rocky ridges where the original vegetation has been cleared; also found in Brachystegia woodlands, lowlands and lower slopes; strandveld, gorges, dry forest margins, evergreen bushland, grasslands, thickets and sometimes riverine.  It occurs as isolated individuals, in close association with other woody species, and does not occur communally in large numbers. It is frost and drought-tolerant.

The species is probably a partial root parasite, growing on the roots of other plants and utilizing the root systems of these hosts, but it does produce its own chlorophyll. As a result this shrub is usually intimately associated with shrubs of other woody species.
Native range
Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania
Tree management

The tree is very slow growing, and requires shade of nurse trees in the early stages of growth.  Being an endangered species, having been heavily exploited for extraction of perfume, farmers should be encouraged to plant this tree on their farmlands.
No pretreatment is required, but nicking the base of the seed improves germination.  Germination reaches 60% after 6 weeks.  The seeds cannot be stored hence should be sowed fresh. There are 10000-11000 seeds per kg.

Easily propagated from fresh seeds and cuttings; wildings and root suckers can also be used.
  Roots and bark are used for tea and as a tonic in soup.  Fruits are edible.  Ripe fruits are eaten raw, with the seed discarded; only as an emergency food, especially by children or herdsmen.
Also used as a source of firewood
Fibre:  The root fibres are used in basketry.
Timber:  The wood is very hard, strong and heavy. It is used for carvings, grain mortars, pestles, pegs, and for building poles and bedsteads.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark was used for tanning leather by the voortrekkers while the root gives a strong red dye. 
Medicine:  A root decoction is used to treat diarrhea in Kenya; a decoction of the bark and heartwood is used to treat sexually transmitted diseases and anaemia in Tanzania.  Extracts from the plant can cure certain diseases, including the killer Hepatitis B.
Ornamental & erosion control:  The tree is used as an ornamental and for soil conservation. The unusual bark and leaf combination make it an interesting subject amongst other trees in a garden; but due to its untidy growth form it is not an attractive tree in a small garden.
Essential oils:  Roots and wood are scented and used to make cosmetics and perfume; and has a lucrative market in Germany, India, Indonesia and South Africa. 
Other services:  It was traditionally used by various Kenyan communities to preserve milk in gourds for long periods."
Ougeinia dalbergioides,"Local names:
 Bengali (pandan,bandhan), Hindi (tinsia,tinis,Sandan,sanaan,kallu vengai,chikkuda,bandhan), Tamil (mokke,kallu), Trade name (sandan)
Ougeinia dalbergioides is a medium-sized, semi-deciduous tree, commonly attaining 40-50 cm DBH and 7-14 meters in height. The stem is often crooked, but in some areas the tree is straight. The bark, varying from pale pinkish-brown to dark bluish grey, is somewhat rough and exfoliates in irregular thin soft scales. 

Leaves pinnately trifoliate, smooth above and lightly pubescent below. Obovate leaflets generally 6-12 cm long, 2-15 cm wide, sizes varying greatly. Leaf margins entire. 

Flowers light-pink to white. The previous years branches generally do not bear flowers. Branches bearing flowers are leafless, while others retain leaves.

Pods with a distinct scam, 5-10 cm long, 1 cm wide, remaining closed until seeds germinate. Mature pods yield 2-5 viable seeds. 

Seeds smooth brown, 10-12 mm long, 5 mm wide. Seed production not heavy each year.

Variants of this species differ morphologically from the normal plants by producing narrower leaves with 4- 6 leaflets instead of 3. They also grow 30% slower than the normal plants. Detailed investigations on the physiology of variant plants are in progress.
Ecology

O. dalbergioides is native to sub-tropical regions of India and a component of mixed deciduous and sal (Shorea robusta) forests. It is associated with pines at the higher limits of its elevation range.
Native range
India, Nepal
Tree management

Young trees and seedlings need a moderate amount of shade. However, once established O. dalbergioides requires full sunlight for its best development. Although young trees are drought and frost sensitive, mature trees are hardy. A tree spacing of 3 x 6 m is recommended for timber production. 

Mean annual growth increment averages between 3-20 mm in DBH. Trials indicate that keeping seedlings free of heavy weed competition improves growth and survival and such trees attain heights of 4-5 m and DBH of 10.5 cm in about 6 years. Conversely, heavy weed competition can kill seedlings. 

Sandan coppices well and produces abundant root-suckers. Fast-growing coppice and root-suckers attain 7-10 m in height and 12-17 cm in DBH after 20 years. Coppice and root-suckers can be managed for timber production. In its native range, forests are commonly managed simultaneously for sandan and teak production. The exploitable diameter for O. dalbergioides timber is generally 30 cm.

Timber exploitation has degraded the natural stands of this species. To reverse this condition, improved natural forest management and the establishment of large scale tree plantations are necessary.
The seeds do not retain their viability for long and should be used within 12 months of maturity. Once collected seed should be properly dried and stored in sealed containers. Seeds weigh 28000-33000/kg.
O. dalbergioides is native to sub-tropical regions of India and a component of mixed deciduous and sal (Shorea robusta) forests. It is associated with pines at the higher limits of its elevation range.
O. dalbergioides is readily propagated from seed. To maximize germination, pods should be broken into fragments containing one seed and soaked in water for 24 hours before sowing. Seed should be sown 1 cm deep. Germination occurs in 3-8 days. 

Direct sowing is very successful and highly recommended. Nursery-propagation accelerates seedling growth, however the large taproot of sandan makes transplanting difficult. Establishment by stump sprouts also gives good results. One-year old seedlings with root-collar diameters of 5 cm are recommended. For stump production, seedlings should be cut 2-3 cm above the root-collar and 20-25 cm below.

 Propagation by root cuttings is successful, but stem cuttings yield poor results.
Poison: The bark is used as a fish poison.
Erosion control: Sandan coppices well and produces abundant root-suckers. This characteristic is particularly useful for controlling erosion along steep banks and eroded hillsides. 
Fodder: The leaves are highly valued as cattle feed. Farmers lop side branches, but often spare the main limbs to assure good growth and future supplies of fodder. In some areas, natural stands of this species are such important fodder resources that timber harvesting is forbidden. Leaves contain 12- 15% crude protein.
Sandan wood is a good fuel with a calorific value of 4 900-5 200 Kcal/kg.
Fibre: Bark fibers are suitable for making rope.
Timber: O. dalbergioides yields a valuable timber. The sapwood is grey and narrow, the heartwood is light golden brown, hard, strong, heavy and elastic-specific gravity is 0.84 and average weight is 865 kg/m³. The wood air seasons slowly without much degradation. The wood can be kiln-seasoned without difficulty, requires slow and careful drying and does not require preservative treatment. It is difficult to work, turns well and takes polish readily.  Though originally considered difficult to peel, it is now frequently utilized for plywood. Sandan timber is used in the manufacture of agricultural implements, construction timbers, furniture and textile mill implements. It is also a specialty timber for marine plywood. 
Medicine: The bark is used against fevers and a sap exudate is used to make a medicine against dysentery.
Nitrogen fixing: As with many other leguminous plants, O. dalbergioides forms nitrogen fixing symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria. Reliable estimates of its nitrogen fixing capacity are not available.
Ornamental: Flowering trees are conspicuous and afford a beautiful sight, making sandan a versatile ornamental tree.
Intercropping:  Sucessful planting in Taungya plantations with the lesser millet (Eleusine coracana) when about 60 cm wide strips are kept clear of the crop have been reported."
Pachystela msolo,"Local names:
 Swahili (msavia,msambia,mochocho,mchanvya)
Pachystela msolo is a medium or tall evergreen tree with many branches; it grows to 20-50 m high, with a dense crown and a deeply fluted and pillared bole to about 3 m. 

Leaves alternate, medium to large, 8-35 x 3-14 cm (rarely larger), dark green, coriaceous, glabrous and shining on upper surfaces; underside slightly silvery, hairy or glaucous, with prominent venation; leaf shape obovate-oblong, 10-16 lateral nerves on each side of the leaf; leaf stalks short, 3-10 mm long.

Flowers small, greenish-white, fragrant, clustered below the leaves on young branchlets and older branches; pedicels short, usually 3-6 mm long.

Fruits are small, green, becoming a dull yellow with ripening; subglobose berries, about 3 x 2.5 cm, and beaked; pulp juicy; seeds ellipsoid, slightly flattened, up to 1.8 cm long; scar is prominent, lateral and occupying over half of surface.
Ecology

The species occurs naturally in lowland rainforests, extending into lower fringes of upland rainforest and riverine forests. It is abundant in lower altitudes, but its frequency in occurrence decreases with rise in altitude. P. msolo grows in areas with great variation in rainfall regime. In its natural range, low rainfall is supplemented by a permanent high groundwater table.
Native range
Benin, Cameroon, Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda
Tree management

P. msolo is a very slow-growing tree. Pollarding seems to increase the quantity of fruit it produces.

In its natural range, low rainfall is supplemented by a permanent high groundwater table.
Ripe fruits are collected from standing trees. P. msolo regenerates naturally by seed and coppice. The species seeds heavily every year. When overmature, the fruit falls to the ground. During or towards the end of the rainy season, there is profuse natural regeneration of the species. However, few seedlings advance to sapling or pole-size stage, mainly because most of the seeds that germinate towards the beginning of the dry season die. Moreover, the few pole-size or mature trees that survive are frequently cut for timber.
  The fruit pulp of P. msolo is edible.
Timber:  The tree is reputed to produce good-quality poles for construction."
Paraserianthes falcataria,"Local names:
 English (moluca,batai,Indonesian albizia,albizia,peacock plume,paraserianthes,white albizia), Filipino (falcata,moluccan sau), Indonesian (sengon laut,jeungjing,sikat), Javanese (sengon laut,sika), Malay (puah,batai,kayu machis), Trade name (batai)
Paraserianthes falcataria is a fairly large tree, up to 40 m tall; bole branchless for up to 20 m; grows to 100 cm or sometimes more in diameter, with a spreading flat crown.

Leaves alternate, bipinnately compound, 23-30 cm long, with rusty pressed hairs and slender angled axis bearing gland above base; leaflets paired, 15-20 pairs on each axis, stalkless, small, oblong, 6-12 mm long, 3-5 mm wide, short-pointed at the tip, topside dull green and hairless, underside paler with fine hair.

Inflorescence axillary consisting of paniculate racemes, the spikes sometimes arranged in panicles; flowers bisexual, 12 mm long, regular pentamerous, subtended to bracts; calyx hairy, valvate, gamosepalous, tubular to cup or bell shaped; corolla sericeous all over, gamopetalous, funnel or bell shaped, cream to yellowish. 

Fruit a chartaceous, flat, straight pod, 10-13 x 2 cm, not segmented, dehiscent along both sutures and winged along ventral suture, puberulous but glabrescent, many seeded (15-20); seed subcircular to oblong, 6 mm long, flat to convex, without aril, dull to dark brown, with a thick sclerified exotesta, not winged; endosperm absent; cotyledons large.
Ecology

A pioneer species, P. falcataria occurs in primary but more characteristically in secondary lowland rainforest and in light montane forest, grassy plains and along roadsides near the sea. It is adapted to peri-humid and monsoonal climates with a dry season of up to 2 (4 max.) months. It is sensitive to fire and easily damaged by strong wind.
In natural stands in Irian Jaya, P. falcataria is associated with species such as Agathis labillardieri, Celtis spp., Diospyros spp., Pterocarpus indicus, Terminalia spp. and Toona sureni.
Native range
Haiti, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands
Tree management

P. falcataria grows so fast that it is sometimes called the ‘miracle tree’. It is even mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s fastest growing tree. On good sites it can attain a height of 7 m in just over a year. Trees reach a mean height of 25.5 m and a bole diameter of 17 cm after 6 years, 32.5 m high and 40.5 cm diameter after 9 years, 38 m high and 54 cm diameter after 12 years, and 39 m high and 63.5 cm diameter after 15 years. 

P. falcataria coppices although coppicing vigour is highly variable. It has been found that growth at 2 x 2 m spacing is significantly faster than at 1 x 1 m. If sawn timber is desired, stands can be thinned to 6 x 6 m at 6-8 years and harvested at 15 years. P. falcataria is commonly used in agroforestry systems, usually in a cutting cycle of 10-15 years, in combination with annual crops in the 1st year and grazing animals in subsequent years.

When planted, it can grow on comparatively poor sites and survive without fertilizer. However, it does not thrive in poorly drained, flooded or waterlogged soils. Growth of young trees in a phosphorous-deficient soil is promoted by inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi Gigaspora margarita and Glomus fasciculatum in combination with Rhizobium. Nitrogen-fixing nodules containing leghaemoglobin are found on roots.

P. falcataria plantations should be kept weed free during the 1st few years.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. There is no loss in viability during 1.5 years in air-dry storage at 4-8 deg. C. For storage, seeds are air dried for 24 hours and then packed in polythene bags. When stored at 4-8 deg. C, the germination rate after 18 months may still be 70-90%. There are 38 000-44 000 seeds/kg.
A pioneer species, P. falcataria occurs in primary but more characteristically in secondary lowland rainforest and in light montane forest, grassy plains and along roadsides near the sea. It is adapted to peri-humid and monsoonal climates with a dry season of up to 2 (4 max.) months. It is sensitive to fire and easily damaged by strong wind.
In natural stands in Irian Jaya, P. falcataria is associated with species such as Agathis labillardieri, Celtis spp., Diospyros spp., Pterocarpus indicus, Terminalia spp. and Toona sureni.
P. falcataria requires great amounts of light and regenerates naturally only when the soil is exposed to sunlight. In the forest, wildings sprout in abundance only when the canopy is open and when soil is cleared from the undergrowth. Wildings can be successfully collected and potted for planting but are delicate and must be carefully handled.

The species can be planted from seedlings, direct seeding or stump cuttings. Small seeds are difficult to collect from the ground and are usually collected by cutting down branches bearing ripe, brown pods. Untreated seeds germinate irregularly; germination may start after 5-10 days but is sometimes delayed for up to 4 weeks. To hasten and ensure uniform germination, soak in boiling water for 1-3 minutes or immerse in concentrated sulphuric acid for 10 minutes followed by subsequent washing and soaking in water for 18 hours. Germination rates can be as high as 80% to almost 100%. 

Seeds of P. falcataria are usually sown by broadcasting, pressed gently into the soil and then covered by a layer of fine sand up to 1.5 cm thick. The soil in the seedbed must be loose and well drained; application of a surface layer of mulch is advisable, and excessive shading should be avoided. Seedlings can be transplanted when they have reached a height of 20-25 cm with a woody stem and a good fibrous root system; this stage can be reached in 2-2.5 months. Container plants are often transplanted into the field when 4-5 months old.

Seed tissue has been successfully used in the Philippines for propagation by tissue culture. Seedlings have epigeal germination.
Plantations of P. falcataria have been established even on tailings left after tin mining. It is planted extensively for reforestation and afforestation of denuded and eroding land.
Erosion control:  Pure stands give a good protective cover to prevent erosion on slopes and are recommended in the Philippines for this purpose on catchment areas sheltered from typhoons.
An activated tree metabolism at the beginning of the wet season synthesizes a complex polysaccharide that increases palatability for cattle of the bark. Leaves are used to feed chickens and goats.
Widely used for fuelwood and charcoal production in spite of its low density and energy value.
Fibre:  P. falcataria trees coppice fairly well, an advantage for pulpwood production. The wood is suitable for pulping and papermaking. It can be used to produce good-quality pulp by mechanical, semi-chemical or chemical processes. Because of its light colour, only a little bleaching is required to achieve good white paper. The neutral, semi-chemical process produces pulp with excellent strength properties. It has also been used for the manufacture of viscose rayon.
Timber:  The comparatively soft timber is suitable for general utility purposes, such as light construction, furniture, cabinet work, lightweight packing materials and pallets, and chopsticks. Because the wood is fairly easy to cut, P. falcataria is also suitable for wooden shoes, musical instruments, toys and novelties, forms and general turnery. P. falcataria is an important source of veneer and plywood and is very suitable for the manufacture of particleboard, wood-wool board and hardboard and has recently been used for blockboard. 
Shade or shelter:  The plant is extensively planted in Southeast Asia as a shade and nurse crop for coffee, cocoa, tea, other crops and young timber plantations. Its fast growth and good shading properties outweigh the disadvantages of its sensitivity to 
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark of P. falcataria has tanning properties.
Nitrogen fixing:  Nodulates and fixes atmospheric nitrogen.
Ornamental:  Suitable as an ornamental, although its brittle branches can be a problem in windy areas.
Soil improver:  The natural drop of leaves and small branches contributes nitrogen, organic matter and minerals to upper layers of soil. The plant’s extensive root system further improves soil conditions by breaking up soils to provide channels for drainage and aeration."
Parinari curatellifolia,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (grysappel), Bemba (mupundu), Chichewa (muula), English (hissing tree,mbola plum,mobola plum,fever tree), French (pobéguin,Mendonça), Lozi (mubula), Luganda (munazi), Lunda (mucha), Ndebele (umkhuna), Nyanja (mbula,mpundu), Portuguese (muchacha
Parinari curatellifolia is a large, evergreen, spreading tree up to 20 m tall with a single bare stem and a dense, roundish to mushroom-shaped crown; bark dark grey and rough; young shoots densely covered with yellow woolly hairs.

Leaves alternate, simple, elliptic to oblong, 3-8 x 2-4 cm, leathery, dark green on top, finely velvety when young but losing these hairs later, densely hairy and grey to yellow underside; apex broadly tapering, often notched; base square; margin entire; petiole short.

Flowers small, white and sweet scented, in short, branched heads or panicles, 4-6 cm in diameter, in leaf axils; stalks and calyces densely covered with yellowish, woolly hairs; bisexual; sepals 5; petals 5; stamens 7 or more, joined at the base in a short ring inserted in the mouth of the receptacle; ovary 2 chambered.

Fruit oval to round, up to 5 x 3.5 cm, russet-yellow to greyish, scaly and pitted, becoming orange-yellow when ripe.

Parinari is the vernacular name for a Brazilian species; the specific name means ‘with leaves like those of Curatella’, a West Indian and South American genus belonging to the Dilleniaceae family; often called the hissing tree because the bark makes a sort of hissing noise when cut with an axe.
Ecology

The sclerophyllous species is never truly gregarious; grows naturally in open, deciduous woodland, especially brachystegia woodland, extending to its upper limits and then scattered in upland grassland; often persisting in cultivated land and present in secondary bushland; Throughout the greater part of its range it is a species of woodland and wooded grassland, both edaphic and secondary; occurs in varying climatic regimes and is particularly common near rivers and in areas of poor drainage. It is sensitive to frost and cold wind. In Zambia it is often considered an indicator of a high watertable and is often left in fields. P. curatellifolia can tolerate small concentrations of copper in the soil.

Tree management

Transplanted into the field or garden after 2 years; care needs to be taken when transferring the seedlings because the taproot damages easily; young plants can be planted in groups of 10 or more, as they occur in nature, and must be watered until they are established; plants grow quite fast; coppice shoots are produced on felled trees. P. curatellifolia does not have an invasive root system, and root suckers are produced after root wounding.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be retained for over 2 years. There are 250-350 seeds/kg.

It is sensitive to frost and cold wind. In Zambia it is often considered an indicator of a high watertable and is often left in fields. P. curatellifolia can tolerate small concentrations of copper in the soil.
The species regenerates naturally from seed, coppice and suckers; most of the trees and young regeneration seen in the field originate from root suckers. Seed lying on the ground is nearly always parasitized, so fresh seeds should be collected from the trees.

The seeds of P. curatellifolia rarely germinate artificially even with pretreatment, due most likely to its hard seed coat. If immersed in boiling water for 15 minutes, allowed to cool and then soaked for 24 hours the seed could still take up to 6 months to germinate. Potted stock raised in the nursery could be planted in the field where partial clearing has been carried out. Regeneration inducement from root suckers could be a feasible technique in areas where the species is semi-cultivated on farmland.
  The fruit has a pleasant tasting, yellow flesh of which 88.2% is carbohydrate; it contains vitamin C. The fruit may be eaten raw or made into a porridge. A delicious syrup is prepared from it that provides the basis of a refreshing, non-alcoholic drink. Seeds are pounded and used for making soup; they can also be eaten and make a passable substitute for almonds.
Game and cattle browse both leaves and fruits; the fruit is used as bait to trap animals such as antelopes.
Apiculture:  The tree produces abundant nectar and pollen, which makes it popular with honey farmers.
P. curatellifolia gives good charcoal.
Timber:  The wood is pink-brown in colour, with a featureless grain scored by many narrow pores, which show up well on the flat or tangential surfaces. It is hard and moderately heavy (720 kg/m³).  P. curatellifolia is borer proof and, although not durable if left exposed to weather, it has been used fairly extensively for rafters, beams, poles, benches, building mortars, railway sleepers, canoes and mine timber. However, it contains silica crystals that make it difficult to work, as they very rapidly blunt saw blades and other tools.
Shade or shelter:  P. curatellifolia is a neat, compact shade tree for the average garden.
Tannin or dyestuff:  An extract from the bark is used in tanning. A pink-brown dye used in basket work is extracted from the bark. Leaves are also used for dyeing.
Lipids:  Seed kernel has a high oil content (37.75%); it is used for paints, varnishes and printing and engraving inks.
Medicine:  A hot fomentation of the bark is used in the treatment of pneumonia. A leaf decoction is either drunk or used in a bath as a fever remedy. Crushed or pulped leaves are used in a dressing for fractures or dislocations, and for wounds, sores and cuts.
Ornamental:  A good tree to grow in orchards or in homegardens.
Soil improver:  The high content of cellulose limits the use of the oil cake. However, it could be used as manure.
Alcohol:  The fruits are made into an intoxicating liquor."
Parkia biglobosa,"Local names:

Parkia biglobosa is a perennial deciduous tree with a height ranging from 7 to 20 m, although it can reach 30 m under exceptional conditions. Crown large, spreads wide with branches low down on a stout bole; amber gum exudes from wounds; bark dark grey brown, thick, fissured.

Leaves alternate, dark green, bipinnate to 30 cm long, pinnae up to 17 pairs with 13-60 pairs of leaflets, 8-30 mm x 1.5-8 mm, of distinctive shape and venation. Leaflets held on a long rachis.

Peduncles 10-35 cm long; capitula 4.5-7 cm long and 3.5-6 cm in diameter, biglobose but distal portion much larger. Hermaphrodite flowers orange or red in colour: calyx 10-13 (16 max.) mm; corolla 10-14 (17 max.) mm long, lobes very short 1-3 mm long, connate in the middle and free or connate at base; filaments exserted about 4 mm beyond calyx mouth. Nectar-secreting flowers: calyx about 6-7 mm long. Staminodial flowers: calyx about 5.5-7 mm long, filaments exserted 2-3 mm beyond calyx mouth. 

Pods, pink brown to dark brown when mature, about 45 cm long and 2 cm wide; may contain up to 30 seeds embedded in a yellow pericarp. Seeds have a hard testa, are large (mean weight 0.26 g/seed) with large cotyledons forming about 70% of their weight.

Robert Brown described the genus Parkia in 1826. He named it after Mungo Park, a Scot who made 2 remarkable journeys of exploration into the interior of West Africa in 1795-1797 and 1805.
Ecology

Occurs on a wide range of natural and semi-natural communities such as open savannah woodlands, but it is most conspicuous and abundant in anthropic communities, principally bush fallow and wooded farmland where cultivation is semi-permanent. The tree can also grow on rocky slopes, stony ridges or sandstone hills. It is a fire-resistant heliophyte.

P. biglobosa occurs in a diversity of agroecological zones, ranging from tropical forests with high and well-distributed rainfall to arid zones where mean annual rainfall may be less than 400 mm. It has a capacity to withstand drought conditions because of its deep taproot system and an ability to restrict transpiration.
Native range
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome et Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Togo, Uganda
Tree management

Deciduous in the dry season; often wholly or partially leafless while flowering; seedlings are harmed by browsing and hence need protection from stock. During the dry season, P. biglobosa retains green leaves with minimal shedding of old mature leaves; those shed are quickly replaced. During the dry season, farmers lop branches to feed their livestock to supplement low-quality grass forage; the age and the frequency of cutting are likely to influence regrowth: young trees cut more frequently and at lower cutting height decline in productivity quicker than old ones.
Orthodox storage behaviour; no loss in viability during 1 year of hermetic storage at 4 deg. C. There are about 2800-6700 seeds/kg.

It has a capacity to withstand drought conditions because of its deep taproot system and an ability to restrict transpiration.
P. biglobosa has 2 types of seed: reddish-dark and dark (black); both occur in every pod, and the ratio of their number varies from 1:20 to 1:5; the reddish-dark seed seems to have a thinner coat, probably a development factor, and germinates earlier than the dark seed if the seeds are not acid treated before sowing. Dark seeds have a hard seed coat and require various pretreatments to ensure good germination rates; acid treatment appears to be the best method; next is by chipping the seeds at 1 end. Germination can also be improved by scalding the seeds for about 7 min and then cooling or soaking them in hot water overnight; usual the germination rate is 75%. P. biglobosa can be established vegetatively in nursery beds by grafting or budding, or by rooting adult cuttings.
Poison:  Bark and pods contain piscicides; the alkaloid parkine that occurs in pods and bark may be responsible. 
  Seeds are fermented to make dawadawa, a black, strong-smelling, tasty food high in protein. Dried fermented seeds keep for more than a year in traditional earthenware pots without refrigeration, and small amounts are crumbled during cooking into traditional soups and stews that are usually eaten with sorghum- or millet-based dumplings and porridges. Because of the savoury taste and the high protein and fat values of the seed, it is sometimes described as a meat or cheese substitute, but it is not usually eaten in large amounts. Dawadawa is rich in protein, lipids and vitamin B2. Parinari curatellifolia is deficient in the amino acids methionine, cystine and trytophan, but fermented beans are rich in lysine. The fat in the beans is nutritionally useful (approximately 60% is unsaturated). Seeds are used as a coffee substitute. Seeds are embedded in a mealy pulp sometimes called dozim, that is high in energy value. It contains up to 29% crude protein and up to 60% saccharose, is rich in vitamin C and high in oil content. The pulp is eaten raw or made into a refreshing drink and is used as a sweetener. For storage, it is pressed into a cake. The fruit provides emergency food during severe droughts. Young pods are sometimes roasted on embers and eaten. Leaves are edible but not commonly eaten. The leaves are mixed with cereal flour and eaten or fermented into balls and used in sauces.
Whole pods are eaten by domestic stock, including cattle. The young seedlings are nutritious and heavily browsed by livestock. An important attribute of P. biglobosa trees is that most of their leaves remain green throughout the dry season and branches are lopped and used as fodder. Seeds are rich in calcium, sodium, potassium and phosphorus.
Apiculture:  P. biglobosa attracts bees and is a popular tree among beekeepers.
Branches are sometimes lopped for firewood.
Fibre:  Pods and roots are used as sponges and as strings for musical instruments.
Timber:  Wood is whitish, moderately heavy, 580-640 kg/cubic m when air seasoned, relatively hard and solid; it smells unpleasant when newly felled, but seasoning does not take long and only occasionally causes shape distortion; easily worked by hand or power tools; nails, glues, varnishes and paints well; mainly useful as a light structural timber, for example, for vehicle bodies, agricultural implements, boxes, crates and barrels, furniture, mortars and pestles, bowls, planks and carvings. Twigs are used to clean teeth; bark stains mouth red and contains saponins that clean teeth.
Shade or shelter:  P. biglobosa is a useful windbreak and shade tree.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Husks of pods mixed with indigo improve the lustre of dye products. Seeds and bark contain tannin, and bark is used in tanning.
Medicine:  Bark is used as a mouthwash, vapour inhalant for toothache, or for ear complaints. It is macerated in baths for leprosy and used for bronchitis, pneumonia, skin infections, sores, ulcers, bilharzia, washes for fever, malaria, diarrhoea, violent colic and vomiting, sterility, venereal diseases, guinea worm, oedema and rickets, and as a poison antidote. Leaves are used in lotions for sore eyes, burns, haemorrhoids and toothache. Seed is taken for tension, and pulp for fevers, as a diuretic and as a mild purgative. Roots are used in a lotion for sore eyes.
Gum or resin:  Mucilage from part of fruit is made into a fluid and used for hardening earth floors and to give a black glaze in pottery; gum exudate is proteinaceous and contains as the constituent sugars galactose, arabinose, glucuronic and 4-0-methyglu
Soil improver:  Soils under P. biglobosa trees are improved by leaf fall.
Intercropping:  It is common practice to grow several crops such as maize, cassava, yams, sorghum and millet under P. biglobosa canopy.
Alcohol:  Fruit pulp can be fermented into an alcoholic beverage."
Parkia speciosa,"Local names:
 Filipino (u’pang), Indonesian (pete,petai papan,peuteuy), Javanese (petai gede,pete,segobang,petai pare), Malay (chou dou,petai,petah,patai,patag,nyiring,cong dou), Thai (sator,sataw,sator dan,sator kow,to dan,to khao)
Parkia speciosa is a tree up to 15-40 m in height and 50-100 cm in diameter. Branchlets are hairy. 

Leaves bipinnate on 2-6 cm long stalks with gland 7-15 mm above stalk base. Pinnae 10-19 pairs, 5-9 cm long, each with 31-38 pairs of opposite linear leaflets, 5-9 mm long and about 2 mm wide, with rounded tip and small pointed lobe or ear at base. 

Flowers small and creamy white, found in densely crowded heads. 

Pods large, 35-55 cm long and 3-5 cm wide, straight or more commonly twisted; dangling in small bundles, green becoming black. Each pod contains 10-18 large seeds. Valves swollen over seeds. Testa soft. 

Robert Brown described the genus Parkia in 1826. He named it after Mungo Park, a Scot who made 2 remarkable journeys of exploration into the interior of West Africa in 1795-97 and 1805. The specific name, ‘speciosa’ is Latin for beautiful, showy.
Ecology

Parkia occurs in scattered lowland rainforests and sometimes also in tall secondary forest, on sandy, loamy and podzolic soils, also in waterlogged locations, in freshwater swamp forest and on riverbanks. The tropical lowland tree requires some shade when young.
Native range
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand
Tree management

For optimal growth ample space and light are necessary.
Seeds of P. speciosa loose their viability very rapidly.
Parkia occurs in scattered lowland rainforests and sometimes also in tall secondary forest, on sandy, loamy and podzolic soils, also in waterlogged locations, in freshwater swamp forest and on riverbanks. The tropical lowland tree requires some shade when young.
Farmers collect seedlings of P. speciosa from the wild and plant them in their homegarden or field. About 90% of the soft seeds show rapid germination in 3-15 days. P. speciosa can be successfully propagated from stem cuttings and budding. Trees propagated by cuttings bloom and set fruit after only a few years and thereby provide the means for cross-breeding, selecting preferred clones, and rapid commercializing what had formerly been a wild-gathered fruit.
  Seeds are sometimes used as a vegetable; they have a garlic flavour and a very strong odour. Due to the foul smell of the green seeds, they are sometimes referred to as the ‘evil-smelling bean’. Half-ripe pods are pickled in salt. The young leaves and fresh parts of the flower stalks can also be eaten raw.
Fibre:  The wood is used in the manufacture of paper.
Timber:  Parkia yields a usually lightweight, occasionally medium-weight hardwood with a density of 350-810 kg/m³ at 15% mc. Heartwood white, yellow-white or pale yellowish-brown, with paler and darker streaks in older trees; not clearly differentiated from the rather wide sapwood, which is paler in colour; very occasionally, a darker-coloured core is present. Grain straight or slightly interlocked; texture moderately coarse and uneven. Wood with unpleasant garlic or beanlike odour when fresh. Shrinkage upon seasoning is low; degrading during seasoning is mainly due to insect attack and blue stain; end-checks have been observed in P. speciosa. Air-drying takes 3-4 months for boards 13 mm thick and 4.5-5 months for those 38 mm thick. Wood is non-durable with a service life of about 1 year, but preservative treatment is easy. The wood of Parkia is used locally for temporary light construction, carpentry, furniture and cabinet making, mouldings, interior finish, cladding, concrete shuttering, boxes and crates, matches, clogs, disposable chopsticks and fishnet floats. General utility plywood has been manufactured from the wood.
Shade or shelter: P. speciosa is sometimes planted as a shade tree, for example, for coffee plantations and in nurseries.
Medicine:  The seeds are known to be hypoglycemic (reducing blood sugar level), and is used traditionally for treating kidney pain, cancer, diabetes, hepatalgia, oedema, nephritis, colic, cholera and as an anthelmintic; also applied externally to wounds and ulcers. The seeds are also valued as a carminative.
Essential oil:  Seeds of P. speciosa contain cystine."
Parkinsonia aculeata,"Local names:
 Amharic (filfile,Ye eyerusalem eshoh), Arabic (sessaban,sesaban), Bengali (balati kikar), Bislama (shewina), Creole (madame naiz,madame yass), Dutch (boonchi strena), English (wonder tree,Mexican palo verde,blue palo verde,takataka tree,Barbados flower f
Parkinsonia aculeata is a small, spiny tree 4-10 m high, with a short and often crooked trunk up to 40 cm in diameter, often branching near the ground with a very open crown of spreading branches and very thin drooping foliage; green throughout the year, although appears leafless after leaflets fall; bark of trunk, branches and twigs smooth, yellow-green or blue-green and slightly bitter; twigs slender, slightly zigzag, finely hairy when young, often with spines, 3 or 1 remaining at nodes, including 2 short spines. 

Leaves specialized, alternate, bipinnately compound, consisting of very short axis ending in spine 1-2 cm long, and 1 or 2 pairs of long, yellow-green drooping side axes, strips or streamers 20-30 cm long and 3 mm broad, flat and slightly thickened; each strip with 20-30 pairs of thin, oblong, green, small leaflets 3-5 mm long, which shed early; strips resembling a blade of grass continue functioning as leaves after leaflets fall.

Flower clusters 7.5-20 cm long at leaf bases, unbranched; flowers several on long, slender stalks, irregular and slightly pea shaped, fragrant, showy, golden yellow, 2 cm or more across; calyx a short tube with 5 narrow yellow-brown lobes turned back; corolla of 5 nearly round petals 10-13 mm long, yellow tinged with orange and hairy at base; upper petal slightly larger, red spotted and turning with withering; 10 green stamens with brown anthers; reddish tinged pistil with hairy, 1-celled ovary and slender style.

Pods nearly cylindrical, 5-10 cm long, 6 mm or more in diameter, narrowed between seeds, long pointed; seeds 1-5, beanlike, oblong, 1 cm long, dark brown; flowers and pods all year. 

The genus name Parkinsonia honours John Parkinson (1567-1650), a British botanist. The specific name means ‘with spines or prickles’. ‘Jerusalem’ in this and other plant names does not refer to the city in Israel but is a corruption from Italian of ‘girasol’, meaning ‘turning towards the sun’.
Ecology

Arid, semi-arid tropical and subtropical with a great temperature range from very hot to several degrees below freezing with frosts. Extremely drought resistant; the dry season can be up to 9 months per year during which P. aculeata drops all its tiny leaflets from the flattened rachis. P. aculeata is native to semi-desert vegetation, especially desert valleys and desert grassland zones. The tree is thorny and reproduces easily; at times it escapes from controlled cultivation and becomes a weed.
Native range
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, United States of America, Venezuela
Tree management

The tree is noted for fast growth; young plants when fertilized will grow up to 1 m annually. The trees regrow vigorously even after drastic pruning. For best growth it requires full sun, and plant will lean towards the sun; in shaded sites its growth is retarded.
Storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained following 3 years of hermetic storage at room temperature with 13% ± 2% mc. Seeds store well for long periods in cool, dry, airtight containers. Pretreatment for germination is not essential. However, if the seeds are soaked in water for 3-4 days or scarified and then soaked in warm water for 1 day, germination will be faster. The germination rate is 30-70% or more in 2-10 days. There are about 11 000-15 000 seeds/kg.

P. aculeata is native to semi-desert vegetation, especially desert valleys and desert grassland zones. The tree is thorny and reproduces easily; at times it escapes from controlled cultivation and becomes a weed.
Natural regeneration occurs by self-seeding but is scarce in arid regions. Grows easily from seed, root or shoot cuttings, or air-layers. Direct sowing is the more popular method, for which seeds are collected from trees before dehiscing.  Plants are ready for transfer to the field 6-10 weeks after germination.
Poison:  Leaves have been reported in Paraguay as toxic, at times containing hydrocyanic acid. 
Useful for reclamation of wastelands, gullied areas and mining spoil.
Erosion control:  As it grows in arid areas and in sandy soils, P. aculeata can be used to afforest eroding and sandy soils.
  The edible fruit pulp is sweet (up to 60% sugar). Its seeds have in the past been used in Mexico for food.
Foliage and pods are browsed by livestock. Young branches are lopped to feed goats and sheep.
Apiculture:  The large, fragrant, golden yellow flowers easily attract bees.
Sapwood yellowish and thick, and heartwood light or reddish-brown; wood moderately hard and heavy (specific gravity 0.6), fine textured, brittle; burns well and is used for firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  The heavy timber (833 kg/m³) is generally too small for sawn applications but finds use as light poles and posts. 
Shade or shelter:  The heavy branching of P. aculeata makes it a suitable windbreak.
Medicine:  Leaf, fruit and stem decoctions are taken orally to treat fever, malaria and as an abortifacient. Flower and leaf extractions in alcohol are applied as a poultice to treat rheumatism.
Nitrogen fixing:  Although this species is a legume, its nitrogen-fixing ability is not known. However, young plants respond to fertilizer.
Ornamental: Attractive ornamental with unusual foliage, vivid flowers and a smooth, green bark.
Its browse resistance and stout thorns make it valuable as a live fence for protecting arable fields in arid and semi-arid areas.
Soil improver:  Provides a large amount of leaf litter that is applied as mulch to the soil."
Paullinia cupana,"Local names:
 English (guarana,Brazilian cocoa)
Paullinia cupana is a scandent shrub or woody liana.

Leaves compound alternate with five folioles and, when tendrils exist, they are axillary.

Inflorescences on axillary racemes or originate on the tendrils. Flowers yellow, male and female, zygomorphous and have five petals and sepals, eight stamens and a trilocular ovary with a glandular semi-disc at the base.

Fruit pear shaped, orange-red, and 3 sided with three-celled capsules, partially open when ripe, revealing 1-3 black or greenish seeds which are covered at the base with a white aril.

There are two varieties of P. cupana; var. cupana differs from var. sorbilis in that it has no tendrils, its folioles are more strongly lobed and its flowers and fruit are bigger. There is no information on the genetic variability of var. cupana, which is little known and studied, var. sorbilis shows a high degree of variability. 

The name 'Guaraná' comes from Guaranis, a tribe of South American Indians. The genus name, Paullinia was taken from a German medical botanist, C.F. Paullini, who 'discovered' the plant.
Ecology

The genus Paullinia is predominantly neotropical, native to the Brazilian Amazon. The climate of the region of origin is Am in Köppen's classification, with an isothermal temperature, mean annual temperature between 22 and 20 deg C. The minimum temperature tolerated is 12 deg C. Annual precipitation must exceed 1400 mm, with rain well distributed during the year. Soils must be deep, medium or heavy in texture, well drained and with high organic matter content.
Native range
Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela
Tree management

Traditional cultivation of guarana is carried out with full exposure to sun on soils with low fertility, low acidity and with high concentrations of aluminium. Spacing of the plants is approximately 4 m x 5 m, which gives 500 plants per hectare. After the second year, pruning is carried out to remove old and diseased branches and those that flowered the previous year. Since 1980, a new type of management has been adopted, using the same layout but with fertilizers and pruning to direct the branches along supports. Guarana must be grown in areas with a climate similar to its region of origin.
Seeds are recalcitrant and lose their viability in 72 hours under normal conditions. Germination can take more than 100 days.

Annual precipitation must exceed 1400 mm, with rain well distributed during the year. Soils must be deep, medium or heavy in texture, well drained and with high organic matter content.
Traditional planting is by sowing. Modern propagation techniques include cuttings, for which misting chambers, grafts and tissue culture propagation are used.
  Guarana is used mainly to produce soft drinks. Seeds contain 2.7-5.8 % caffeine as well as theophylline and theobromine. Seeds are roasted and their seed coat removed; this is marketed as guarana en rama (raw guarana). Seeds are usually immersed in water to form a paste. From this are made sticks, which, after being dried over a slow fire and smoked for one month, are marketed. The traditional way of preparing the drink consists of grating part of the stick in water to produce an infusion. The guarana carbonated drinks industry began in 1907 and the product became Brazil's national drink during the 1940s. Nowadays, guarana is marketed as sticks and soluble or insoluble powder and is used industrially for the production of carbonated drinks, syrups and herbalists' products.
Medicine: Guarana is attributed antipyretic, antineuralgic and antidiarrhoeal properties and is reputed to be a powerful stimulant, an analgesic comparable to aspirin and an anti-influenza agent. The Rainforest tribes have used guarana mainly as a stimulant, astringent and in treating chronic diarrhoea.
Essential oil:  The essential oil isolated from powdered seeds of guarana has 9 identifiable constituents: 2 methylbenzenes, a cyclic monoterpene, 2 cyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 2 methoxyphenylpropenes and 2 alkylphenol derivatives.
Other services:  Guaraná plays an important role in the culture of the Guarani tribe, as this herb is believed to be magical, a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength. They also tell the myth of a 'Devine Child', that was killed by a serpe"
Paulownia imperialis,"Local names:
 Chinese (maopaotong,zihuapaotong,rongmaopaotong,ribenpaotong,zitong), Dutch (Anna-paulownaboom), English (royal paulownia,princess tree,foxglove tree,empress tree), French (paulownia de Chine,arbré d'anna paulownia,paulownia tomenteux), German (blauglock
Paulownia imperialis is a deciduous tree attaining a height of 12-16 m, occasionally over 20 m. The crown is open and domed, containing relatively few branches that often begin quite near the ground. Bark is smooth and delicately streaked, reddish-grey in colour on young trees and of a distinct grey hue in older trees.

Opposite leaves heart shaped with a basal notch, a light colouring of downy hairs on their top side and densely pubescent underside; entire, measuring up to 35 x 25 cm, with a stalk 10-15 cm long.

Flowers pale-violet to blue-purple, slenderly campanulate, up to 6 cm long, arranged on panicles 20-30 cm long.

Fruits grow on stalks, ovoid in shape, whitish-green in colour and sticky to the touch. About 3 x 1.8 cm in size; 2-10 grow on each panicle, each opening in 2 valves releasing winged seeds 3-5 mm.

P. imperialis was named in honour of Anna Pavlovna (1795-1865), daughter of Czar Paul I of Russia and wife of Prince (later King) Willem of the Netherlands.
Ecology

P. imperialis prefers a warm temperate to warm climate. Studies in China have shown that it flourishes best at daytime temperatures of 24-30 deg. C; its height growth ceases at daytime temperatures of 15-20 deg. C. Sufficient ventilation of the soil is vital; on poorly draining sites, after 3-5 days of uninterrupted rainfall P. imperialis casts off its leaves and dies. It is easily damaged by wind.
It is an intolerant pioneer species, colonizing cleared disturbed areas such as roadsides, mined areas, sanitary landfills, abandoned agricultural soils, and deep, moist but well-drained alluvial soils along waterways.
Native range
China
Tree management

P. imperialis grows extremely quickly. Stock grown from seeds attains a height of 3-4 m by the end of the 1st year, with a diameter of 3-5 cm at ground level. Root cuttings can be as high as 4-5 m, occasionally 8 m, after 1 year. Field planting is recommended of young plants 4-5 m tall with a diameter 4-6 cm just below the crown. Under favourable, conditions a large tree may produce as many as 20 million seeds in a year. Paulownia is a pioneer species requiring direct sunlight. For this reason, young trees should be kept free from weed competition. A spacing that results in 500 trees/ha (about 2.75 x 2.75 m) is recommended to produce high-quality trees of good form.
Orthodox storage behaviour; 85-93% germination after 3 years hermetic storage at 4 deg. C. There are between 4 and 6 million seeds/kg, or about 6200 seeds/g.

It is an intolerant pioneer species, colonizing cleared disturbed areas such as roadsides, mined areas, sanitary landfills, abandoned agricultural soils, and deep, moist but well-drained alluvial soils along waterways.
Seeds germinate within 20-30 days after sowing. The tree can be readily propagated by vegetative means using root cuttings and root suckers. Underdeveloped plants are retained in the nursery, pruned back after they shed their leaves and transplanted to the field a year later.
Its tenacity in rooting and its tolerance of rocky, disturbed and relatively infertile soils boosts its potential use in reclamation of surface mines, for example in Kentucky, USA.
Apiculture:  In Kentucky this valuable tree provides pollen and nectar for bees (Hill and Webster,1995).
Fibre:  P. imperialis yields an excellent chemical pulp of a quality far superior to that of other fast-growing, broadleaved tree species.
Timber:  The wood has a uniformly coloured, light-brown heartwood, and a narrow, light-grey sapwood. P. imperialis is the lightest wood grown in China (specific gravity 0.3 g/m³). It is odourless, has good physical properties and is easy to season but is only moderately durable. Because of its above-average acoustic properties, it is used in China for making traditional musical instruments. Its other applications include models and glider construction, sculptures, small utensils and domestic articles. In Japan, it is used for making matches, wooden shoes and crates. Plantation-grown wood from Brazil is often utilized for simple furniture. The popularity of P. imperialis among the Chinese has inaugurated the convenient custom of planting a sapling at the birth of a daughter. By the time the girl is old enough to get married the tree is big enough to be used for the construction of her wardrobes, which are important articles in her dowry.
Shade or shelter:  P. imperialis is suitable for planting in shelterbelts.
Lipids:  Oil for varnishing is obtained from the seed.
Medicine:  The leaves, flowers, fruits and roots are used in China for making medical decoctions. An aqueous solution prepared from the leaves and capsules is prescribed for daily application over the head to promote a healthy growth of hair, and another for turning grey hair black. An aqueous solution prepared from the leaves and wood is prescribed for swollen feet. A tincture prepared from heating the inner bark with water and whiskey is administered internally to patients having high fever and delirium. The leaves steamed in vinegar or the bark fried in vinegar are prescribed as a dressing for bruises. An aqueous concoction made from the flowers and other Chinese plants is administered internally for the cure of ailments of the liver or bile that cause dizziness.
Ornamental:  As a park and ornamental tree, it is widespread in temperate zones including Germany (in the wine-growing areas), southern Europe and USA.
Intercropping:  Particularly well suited for intercropping with wheat, cotton and maize at spacings of 5 x 20 m and 5 x 50 m; the resulting yields of wheat are 16% higher, those of cotton 7% higher, and those of maize more than 11% higher than those from plots without P. imperialis."
Paulownia tomentosa,"Local names:
 Chinese (maopaotong,zihuapaotong,ribenpaotong,zitong), Dutch (Anna-paulownaboom), English (royal paulownia,princess tree,foxglove tree,empress tree), French (paulownia de Chine,arbré d'anna paulownia), German (paulownie,Kaiser- Paulownie,filziger Blauglo
Paulownia tomentosa is a deciduous tree of height of 9-21 m at maturity, depending on site and management. Twigs smooth, brown, dotted with lenticels. Bark brownish grey with shallow fissures.

Leaves heart-shaped and enormous especially on sprout where leaves up to 3 ft across have been observed, covered with mass hairs on the underside

Flowers showy, violet or blue, perfect, in terminal panicles up to 25 cm long.

Fruits ovoid, pointed, woody capsules about 3-4 cm long, turning brown in fall when mature and persist on the tree through winter. 

Seeds tiny, winged and flat, about 0.15 to 0.3 cm long.

Paulownia imperialis was named in honour of Anna Pavlovna (1795-1865), daughter of Czar Paul I of Russia and wife of Prince (later King) Willem of the Netherlands. The specific epithet means thickly and evenly covered with short hairs in reference to the leaves.
Ecology

This species  is a vigorous colonizer and has been reported as a weed for its poor form and rather large shade leaves on fertile soils. Paulownia spp prefer warm climates.
Native range
China
Tree management

Coppices readily. Management for quality saw logs involves good post-planting care and several stem-pruning operations. Stems are prone to fungal attacks through pruning wounds. Injuries should therefore be avoided.  In China, its source of origin, yields of 36-53 cu m/ha have been reported.
Dry fruits can be collected and opened by hand any time before they disperse their seeds.  It has been estimated that there are about 6 million seeds/ kg. Seeds are kept in dry sealed containers, or stratified between moist layers of a mixture of peat and sand.
This species  is a vigorous colonizer and has been reported as a weed for its poor form and rather large shade leaves on fertile soils. Paulownia spp prefer warm climates.
Seeds exhibit no dormancy, but light is necessary for germination. Germination can be tested on creped cellulose at an incubation temperature of 20-30°C, with light during the warm period. The rapid growth rate of Paulownia species has sparked interest in the germination of their seeds as indicated by selected recent literature. Seeds should be sown on the top of flats of milled peat, covered with clear plastic film and given light.  When seedlings are big enough to handle they can be pricked out to pots.
In the USA, for instance, it seems well adapted to harsh micro-climates on surface mines and may aid in the reclamation of such sites.
Leaves make good fodder for pigs, sheep and rabbits.
Fibre: Its rapid early growth has attracted the interest of the paper industry.
Timber: This species is not grown for its biomass alone, but also for its use as a quality furniture wood, veneer, carving and musical instruments.
Shade or shelter: It plays an important service role as a windbreak wherever it grows. 
Ornamental: its rapid growth, attractive flower, and excellent wood quality make it a genus that needs to be considered for further use in the United States.
Intercropping:  The roots occupy a different layer than most annual crops and this suggests its potential for intercropping. However when propagated by cutting, the tree forms an extensive lateral root system and loses its deep rooting characteristics."
Pausinystalia johimbe,"Local names:
 English (johimbe), Trade name (yohimbe), Yoruba (idagbon)
Pausinystalia johimbe is a tree 9-30 m tall; with ternate vegetative and generative ramification, rarely decussate. Bark usually occurs in channeled pieces, 4-10 mm, thick with a varying tinge of red in the grey-brown or brown outer and inner surfaces. The outer surface is longitudinally furrowed and bears numerous narrow, transverse cracks at fairly regular intervals of 1-2 cm.

Leaves with petiole up to 5 mm long; blades 24-47 x 10-17.5 cm glabrous, obovate, cuneate or rounded, sometimes angustate or cordate at the base, acumen less than 5 mm long; (8-)13-18 pairs of prominent secondary nerves and reticulate intersecondary nerves; domatia, if present, glabrous intermediate between crypt- and pit type.

Inflorescence terminal or axillary, 10-21(-10) cm long and 9-15 cm wide; stipules at the base persistent. Flowers (4-)5-merous. Calyx outside densely hairy, inside with many long hairs.

Capsule almost 100% septicidal and somewhat loculicidal, 1-1.5 x 0.6 cm. Seeds 8-12 x 1.8-2.5 mm. 

P. johimbe is closely related to P. macroceras (K. Schum.) Pierre and historically they have been exploited for the same purpose. The species are easily distinguished through slash characters. The difference being that P. johimbe oxidizes red-brown very slowly and P. macroceras oxidizes very rapidly.
Ecology

Occurs mostly in the Atlantic evergreen forest with Caesalpiniaceae, an extensive forest formation extending from S.E. Nigeria to Congo. The species occurs mainly in closed canopy forest. Most common in coastal forest, although not widespread throughout its range. Endemic to its region.
Native range
Cameroon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria
Tree management

A fast growing tree but never reaches great diameter, with the maximum being around 50 cm dbh. The species coppices well, producing strong, highly phototrophic shoots, and would be an ideal candidate for a clonal propagation programme once desirable phenotypes have been identified. 
The bark is used to extract yohimbine; the main stem gives the best material but is not rich in alkaloids until the tree is 15-20 years of age when it can contain 2-15%. Bark exploitation is a seasonal activity as the yohimbine levels highest during the rainy season.
Produces prolific quantities of seed, the characteristics of which indicate that it might lend itself to long-term storage.
Occurs mostly in the Atlantic evergreen forest with Caesalpiniaceae, an extensive forest formation extending from S.E. Nigeria to Congo. The species occurs mainly in closed canopy forest. Most common in coastal forest, although not widespread throughout its range. Endemic to its region.
Although the seed and seedlings need light for their development, they cannot survive in full sun and desiccate and die rapidly. The older stems (>3 m high or 5 cm dbh), however, are able to grow and reproduce in high light situations lending themselves to inclusion in both agroforestry and monoculture systems. Natural regeneration is good. For seed collection, the optimum period for fieldwork in both Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea would be between November-January.
Poison:  Poisonous doses of yohimbe are reported to paralyze respiration and the drug can cause severe hypotension, abdominal distress and weakness. It can also be used as an ichthytoxicant (fish poison).
A preferred fuelwood species.
Fibre:  The inner bark is utilized as straps for hunting panniers.
Timber:  The young poles are used for construction purposes. The species is widely used as a snare-trap mechanism due to its flexibility.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark contains tannins.
Medicine:  The bark contains up to 6% of a mixture of alkaloids, the principle one being yohimbine, which is also known as aphrodine, quebrachine or corynine. The presence and amount of alkaloid activity in P. johimbe bark is highly variable. P. johimbe, is the source of the only clinically-proven cure for impotence and has long been used as a traditional stimulant in Africa. Both the crude drug and yohimbine have a long history of use as aphrodisiacs in Western medicine in both prescription and herbal markets. Yohimbe is symatolytic and hypotensive and has a local anaesthetic action similar to that of cocaine but it is not mydriatic. The vasodilating action of yohimbe is particularly strong on the sex organs, hence its aphrodisiac action. P. johimbe is also used as a local anaesthetic, a mild stimulant to prevent drowsiness, a hallucinogen, a treatment for angina, a hypotensive, a general tonic, a performance enhancer for athletes, a remedy to increase the clarity of the voices of singers during long festivals and as a treatment to increase the resilience of hunting dogs. Yohimbine-related products have also been widely used as a vetinerary medicine for the promotion of sexual proclivity amongst stud animals. Remedies are taken in two forms: powder (ground bark) and liquid (bark boiled in water).
Intercropping:  Because P. johimbe is a middle-story tree, it has the potential to be an ideal species for farmers to grow in their fields in agroforestry systems."
Peltophorum africanum,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (dopperkiaat,huilboom,huilbos), Bemba (mwikalankanga), English (African wattle,Rhodesian black wattle,African false wattle,weeping wattle), Lozi (mushande,mulungwa), Luganda (mwezenyele), Lunda (mwezenyele), Ndebele (umsehla), Nyanja (mteta,mny
Peltophorum africanum is a small to medium-size tree, 5-10 m tall, with a spreading crown, frequently branched from near the ground or 2- to 3-stemmed from ground level; bark smooth and grey on the young branches; twigs covered in reddish-brown hairs, but brown to grey and rough with lengthwise grooves on older branches and stems.

Leaves alternate, compound, bipinnate, with 4-7 pairs of pinnae, each bearing 10-12 (or up to 23) pairs of feathery leaflets; leaflets oblong, averaging 7 x 2 mm but variable in size, dull green top side, pale green underside; apex rounded with a fine, hairlike tip; base asymmetric; margin entire; petiole and rachis covered with dense, rusty brown, velvety hairs; stipule distinctive in appearance, like small compound leaves, but falling early; when not in flower P. africanum can easily be confused with an acacia tree, except that it is completely without thorns. 

Flowers very showy, bright yellow, in dense axillary sprays up to 15 cm long; all floral parts in 5s; flower stalks and the backs of sepals covered with brown, velvety hairs; petals about 2 cm in diameter, bright yellow and crinkled.

Fruit a flat pod, elliptic, tapering to apex and base, up to 10 x 2 cm with a winglike margin, very thinly woody, almost leathery, greyish-brown or yellow-tan and ripening to a dark brown, hanging in dense clusters, indehiscent.

The generic name is derived from the Greek meaning ‘shield-bearing’ and refers to the shape of the stigma; ‘africanum’ simply means from Africa.
Ecology

A fast-growing, frost- and drought-resistant tree commonly occurring at medium to low altitudes, in wooded grassland and along marginal valleys. It is resistant to a fair amount of drought.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

P. africanum is a fairly fast-growing tree, achieving 1-1.5 m/year; will withstand some frost but needs protection for the 1st 2-3 years. When grown as a bonsai tree, an adult shape and a thick corky bark form in 2-4 years, with the leaves much reduced. The root system is not aggressive.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability has been maintained following 3 years hermetic storage at room temperature with 13 + or -2% mc; approximately 1200-3300 seeds/kg.
A fast-growing, frost- and drought-resistant tree commonly occurring at medium to low altitudes, in wooded grassland and along marginal valleys. It is resistant to a fair amount of drought.
Fresh seed must be placed in hot water and left overnight to soak. Sow the following morning in flat seedling trays or directly into black nursery bags filled with a mixture of river sand and compost (5:1); keep moist. Germination percentage is high; seeds take 3-10 days to germinate. Seedlings and young plants transfer well.
Poison:  The gum is reputed to be poisonous. 
Young leaves, and especially the pods, are relished by cattle and goats. A valuable tree to have in the veld on cattle and game farms, for the leaves and twigs are eaten by elephant, black rhino, giraffe, kudu, impala and grey duiker.
Apiculture:  An important tree for beekeepers, as it is a good source of nectar and pollen.
P. africanum is a relatively good source of fuelwood.
Timber:  The sapwood is attractive and has a wavy grain of light-brown colour interspersed with light pink; pitting adds to the grain character. The proportion of heartwood is very small; it is reddish, close grained, of medium weight, fairly hard and tough, and is almost termite proof if well seasoned. It takes a good polish and works easily. Although its size limits its use, P. africanum has good-quality timber. It is used mainly to produce tool handles, carvings and similar small items but is sometimes used for furniture and wagons.
Shade or shelter:  P. africanum can be successfully planted along fences to give shade protection to smaller stock and game during the hot summer months. 
Medicine:  The bark and roots are commonly used in traditional medicine. Bark is chewed to relieve colic; an infusion, sometimes with leaves, is taken orally to relieve a variety of stomach disorders such as diarrhoea and dysentery and to get rid of intestinal parasites. Steam from a hot bark decoction is applied to sore eyes and, in serious cases, it is dropped into the eyes. The powdered decorticated root is applied to wounds to hasten healing, and a decoction is taken by mouth or gargled to treat sores in the throat. The roots are also boiled in water and used as an enema. Leaves are boiled and the steam directed into the mouth to relieve toothache. The Zulu of South Africa use the tree as part of a mixture to cure infertility.
Ornamental:  An excellent garden shade tree, beautiful in flower. It is said to have all the requirements of a perfect avenue tree. Popular as a bonsai subject."
Peltophorum dasyrhachis,"Local names:
 English (peltophorum), Indonesian (soga,petaian), Lao (Sino-Tibetan) (s'a:z kha:m,sa:ph'ang,sa f'ang), Malay (jemerelang,batai), Thai (nonsi,arang), Vietnamese (lim x[ej]t,lim v[af]ng)
Peltophorum dasyrhachis is a deciduous tree, up to 30 m tall, with a straight trunk and rather diffuse crown; root system with well-developed taproot and few superficial lateral roots; trunk up to 70 cm in diameter; bark up to 10 mm thick, reddish-brown inside; young branches reddish-tomentose, glabrescent.

Seed flattened oblongoid, 10-12 mm x 5 mm, transversely positioned.

Seedling with epigeal germination; hypocotyl 4-6 cm long; cotyledons stalked, 3-nerved, glabrous.

P. dasyrhachis (often erroneously spelled 'dasyrrhachis') is related to P. pterocarpum (DC.) Backer ex K. Heyne, an important source of 'soga' dye.  P. dasyrhachis can be distinguished by its crown that is uneven and not umbrella-shaped, its branched stipules, and its thick, reddish tomentum.  The two species have occasionally been confounded in the literature.  In northern Vietnam, a form of P. dasyrhachis occurs with unbranched stipules and early falling bracts, named var. tonkinense (Pierre) K. & S.S. Larsen.
Ecology

P. dasyrhachis is found in secondary, deciduous or evergreen forest.  Due to its relatively deep rooting system, it is drought tolerant.  Its hairiness and fairly thick bark have been associated with its tolerance of fire.
Native range
Malaysia, Thailand
Tree management

Husbandry: It has been tested as a tree in alley-cropping systems.  When unpruned, it provides a rather dense shade to control weeds during fallow periods, and can be managed in hedges without too much shading of inter-row crops.  Because its growth rate is slower than that of Leucaena Leucocephala (Lamk) de Wit and Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp., it requires less frequent pruning.  Upon pruning, trees resprout abundantly and form a dense hedge. In Malaysia, trees may grow up to 7 m tall  with a stem diameter of 5 cm in 2 years.

When hedge were pruned 2-4 times per year, an annual yield of prunings of 8 t/ha was found in Lampung (Indonesia), containing 200 kg nitrogen.
The weight of 1000 seeds is about 37 g.

P. dasyrhachis is propagated by seed or cuttings.
Its use in the reclamation of Imperata cylindrica (L.) Raeuschel grasslands is being tested; in Indonesia and Malaysia, young trees planted in tall Imperata grasland and left untended after planting remained alive, but grew slowly.
Erosion control: The slow rate of decomposition of the leaves reduce erosion.
It is suitable as firewood.
Timber: The yellowish-red heartwood is heavy, but brittle and is attacked by termites and boring insects. It is locally used for planks in house-building, but is of little market value.
Shade or shelter: In the first half of the 20th century, P. dasyrhachis was used as a shade tree mainly in coffee in Java.  In central Thailand it is maintained after bush fallow as a shade tree for fruit trees and for its role in soil improvement.
Medicine: The bark is used in an infusion for coughs.
Soil improver: Due to a fairly high content of polyphenolic substances, leaf litter decomposition is slow, allowing a humus layer to build up in the soil. When hedge were pruned 2-4 times per year, an annual yield of prunings of 8 t/ha was found in Lampung (Indonesia), containing 200 kg nitrogen.
Other services: The slow rate of decomposition of the leaves is also contributes to the suppresion of weeds.  Seeds of Imperata cylindrica hardly germinate in soil covered by the leaves."
Peltophorum pterocarpum,"Local names:
 English (rain tree,golden flame,yellow poinciana,copper-pod,rusty shield bearer,sagabark peltophorum,yellow flame,yellow gold mohur,yellow flamboyant), Filipino (jamerelang laut,siar), Hindi (perungondrai,kondacinta,ivalvagai,bonmeza), Indonesian (soga j
Peltophorum pterocarpum is a deciduous tree usually reaching a height of 15 (-24) m, although it may attain 50 m and a diameter of 50 (-100) cm. Bark smooth, grey; crown dense, spreading.

Leaves large, 30-60 cm long, with 8-10 pairs of pinnae each bearing 10-20 pairs of oblong leaflets 0.8-2.5 cm long with oblique bases.

Flowers orange-yellow, each about 2.5 cm in diameter, fragrant, particularly at night; inflorescence brown-tomentose, panicles terminal with rust-coloured buds. 

Fruits 1-4 seeded pods, flat, thin, winged, 5-10 cm long, dark red when ripe, then turning black.

P. pterocarpum has a deep root system. The specific epithet 'pterocarpum' alludes to its winged seed.
Ecology

Under natural conditions, P. pterocarpum is a lowland species, rarely occurring above an altitude of 100 m. It frequently grows along beaches and in mangrove forests, especially the inner margins of mangroves. In Java it is also found growing wild in Imperata grassland fields and teak forests. The species prefers open or disturbed forest conditions.

P. pterocarpum will grow in tropical climates with a dry season of 1-3 months. It thrives best under more or less seasonal conditions in coastal vegetation, rain forests and savanna woodlands.
Native range
Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

P. pterocarpum is fast-growing, attaining a height of 9 m in 3 years and flowering when around 4 years. Agroforestry trials in south Sumatra with hedgerows spaced at 4 m intervals and cut 2-4 times a year indicated that, over a 3-year period, an average pruning yield of 8 tons/ha was possible; the umbrella-shaped crowns which developed following cutting allowed little light to reach the ground. After the first year of establishment, little effort is needed to maintain plantations. Stands will usually survive, even with thick ground cover, such as Imperata or other tall grasses.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Germination is hastened by scarifying one end of the hard seed coat, softening the seed coat in dilute acid, or immersing the seed in boiling water for 2 minutes followed by soaking it in cold water for one night. Germination has been recorded at 78%.

P. pterocarpum can be propagated by seeds, grafting or branch cuttings. Seedlings are best raised in the nursery for one year before transplanting to the field. Grafts or cuttings may be used to obtain better uniformity for roadside trees. Wildings have also been successfully used for planting.
P. pterocarpum is a fast-growing tree with potential use for reforestation
It is suitable for use as a fodder.
Apiculture: In India, it is a source of pollen for the dammer bee (Trigona iridipennis).
The tree is used as fuelwood.
Timber:  The sapwood is greyish-white, turning grey-brown on aging. The heartwood is light reddish-brown or black, moderately hard, moderately heavy, and somewhat lustrous, with a straight to interlocking grain. The wood is used locally for light construction purposes, cabinet making, sawn or hewn building timbers, woodware, woodcarving and marquetry.
Shade or shelter:  P. pterocarpum is a widely-appreciated shade tree, due to its dense spreading crown. It is used in shelterbelts because it is wind firm.
Tannin or dyestuff: The bark of P. pterocarpum has been an important component of the dark or black 'soga' dye in Java, used for batik work. It is also used for tanning leather, and preserving and dyeing fishing nets. In Indonesia, the bark is used for fermenting palm wine.
Medicine: In traditional medicine it is used as an astringent to cure or relieve intestinal disorders after pain at childbirth, sprains, bruises and swelling or as a lotion for eye troubles, muscular pains and sores. It is also used for gargles and tooth powders.
Nitrogen fixing:  It has the ability to fix nitrogen.
Ornamental:  Yellow flame is a very beautiful and elegant ornamental tree. The beautiful golden-yellow flowers may be used as cut flowers.
The tree can be used as a hedge.
Soil improver:  Copper-pod is a source of green manure.
Intercropping:  It has been tested in rotational alley-cropping/fallow systems in Sumatra, where it shows promise (Van Noordwijk et al., 1992). It has a deep root system. Young trees are often planted in an intercropping system with mahogany or Tectona grandis."
Pentaclethra macroloba,"Local names:
 Creole (koeroebaharo,trysil,koloballi,koorooballi), English (oil bean tree), Portuguese (pracaxy,paroacaxi,paranacachy,parachy), Spanish (gavilán,carbonero,palo de aceite,quebracho,sangredo,mulato), Trade name (fine leaf)
Pentaclethra macroloba is a medium to large tree 40 m tall and 1.3 m diameter at breast height. The bark is  smooth, grey-brown

Leaves biparipinnate, to 30 cm long, with numerous small leaflets giving a feather-like appearance

Flowers hermaphrodite, small, crowded in 15-20 cm long, dense racemes. There are almost 200 flowers per raceme but only 1-5 flowers develop into fruits

Fruit dehiscent pod, 20-50 cm long by 4-6 cm wide, dark brown, 3-8 seeds per pod. 

Seed asymmetric, lack endosperm and differ from a typical mimosoid seed; seed coat brown with longitudinal stone cells forming fine lines on the surface

There are two other species in the genus  P. macrophylla Benth and
 P. eetveldeana De Wild. & Th. Dur., both from tropical Africa. All the three species have rich oily seeds
Ecology

It is a lowland species. In humid tropical forests it is one of the dominant canopy trees reaching 30-35 m, often found growing near rivers and in swampy areas.
Native range
Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela
Tree management

The adaptability of this species to a wide range of sites makes it a useful plantation species. This species tolerates waterlogging and shade. Stand establishment is by using natural regeneration and direct seeding. In Costa Rica, it is normally grown with Carapa guianensis
The pods are collected from the trees in July-August when they turn dark grey and before opening. The dehiscence is explosive and seeds can be thrown 10 m or more away from the mother tree. They are transported in open bags to the processing site and must at all times be protected from wind and direct sun. The pods are dried in the shade for one day and the seeds extracted manually

The seeds storage behaviour is intermediate. They lose viability very quickly and do not seem to tolerate desiccation or low temperatures. After collection, the seeds must be handled very gently, kept moist and well aerated. After about one week most seeds will have lost viability. There are about 300 seeds/kg.
It is a lowland species. In humid tropical forests it is one of the dominant canopy trees reaching 30-35 m, often found growing near rivers and in swampy areas.
P. macroloba is usually propagated by seeds and suckers. The seeds are sown in germination beds but must be transplanted before the first bi-paripinate leaves develop.
It is preferable to sow the seeds with the pointed end down. They should be covered with a fine layer of substrate and the substrate must be kept moist at all times

Fresh seeds have high germination rate (often 90%). Germination starts 8-10 days after sowing and continues for about 30 days. Germination takes place regardless of light conditions and the seedlings grow under shade as well as in direct sun. The seedlings produce 14-17 small, scaly leaves before the first biparipinate leaves emerge. If the shoot is damaged, axilliary buds from the scaly leaves take over growth. After 4-5 months when the plants are 35-40 cm tall, they are ready for transplanting into the field.
Poison: Both seeds and bark contain a toxin, and long contact with sawdust and bark may cause allergy
It has been used to rehabilitate over exploited savanna areas in Africa due to its rapid regeneration and coppicing ability.
 The seeds are edible and also produce a cooking oil (owala oil), widely used in Africa. Seeds contain 45-48% lipid, 27-28% protein and 12-14% carbohydrates
The wood is a source of firewood
Timber: The wood is hard, heavy, tough and strong with a specific gravity in the range of 750-850 kg/m3 and often used as a substitute for mahogany. The wood is attractive but has no distinctive figure or grain. It can be used in heavy construction, railway sleepers, furniture, house frames, scaffolding and floor beams
Tannin or dyestuffs: The bark is a source of tannins
Lipids: The seeds have high oil content that may be used industrially in lubricants and soap manufacture
Medicine: Seeds and bark have multiple medicinal uses. It is used against snakebites, ulcers and insect bites. The bark is a remedy for dysentery
Nitrogen fixing: As a nitrogen-fixing pioneer species, P. macroloba has great potential in forest regeneration and reclamation of degraded lands.
It is used as a live firebreak in the lower Congo
Intercropping: It is inter-planted with other species"
Pentaclethra macrophylla,"Local names:
 English (oil of bean tree), Fula (atawa,ataa), Wolof (atawa,ataa)
Pentaclethra macrophylla trees grow to about 21 m in height and about 60 cm girth. Have a characteristic low branching habit and an open crown, which allows substantial light under its canopy. The bole produces a reddish-orange coloration after a slash is made. Stem form is usually crooked and buttressed. Some are straight-stemmed and less buttressed trees, which can pass for good timber, are occasionally seen in the forests. Bark is greyish to dark reddish brown, thin and patchy with irregular pieces flaking off.

Leaves possess a stout angular petiole. The compound leaves are usually about 20-45 cm long and covered with rusty hairs giving a scurry effect particularly along the upper surface but this eventually falls off. There are 10-12 pairs of stout opposite pinnae. The middle pairs are 7-13 cm long and also have rusty hairs along the central grove. There are usually 12-15 pairs of opposite stalkless pinnules (leaflets), each 12-15 cm long, 5-10 mm broad, with the middle pairs longest. Leaflets often have a rounded tip but are sometimes notched; the base is unequal. 

The inflorescences are spicate and the flowers pentamerous, creamy-yellow or pinkish-white and sweet smelling. In addition to the 5 stamens are 10-15 staminodes.

The pods are 40-50 cm long and 5-10 cm wide. Fruit splits open explosively with the valves curling up. This is the form in which they appear on most trees. Usually, pods contain between 6-10 flat glossy brown seeds, which may vary in site. The seeds are up to 7 cm long.
Ecology

P. macrophylla occurs from Senegal to Angola and also to the Islands of Principe and Sao Tome. This multipurpose tree is endemic to the humid and some parts of the sub-humid zones of West Africa. It is more common in the Rain forest and in the Lophira-Triplochiton association but individuals are found elsewhere in the high forest zone. Often it occurs near the streams and on the edges of damp depressions and frequently seen as a small tree of untidy habit and large crown on roadsides and farms. In such places it is usually a relic, having been left on account of its hard wood. It does not occur in the highlands although; growth can be good where rainfall is adequate.
Native range
Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Togo
Tree management

After about 2-years growth in the forest, trees become relatively fire resistant and re-sprout readily when lopped. The unusual feature of leaf loss during the wet seasons has been observed in the field on some individual trees of P. macrophylla and could be an important trait for selection for farmers. The species is relatively fast growing and seedlings will achieve a height of 1.5 m in the first year on good sites.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant; storage at 15 deg. C can extend longevity for about 3 months. There are approximately 50-80 seeds/kg. A seed pre-treatment (mechanical scarification and soaking in water for 24 hours) enhances germination. Germination takes place in 14-16 days and is about 87%.

In such places it is usually a relic, having been left on account of its hard wood. It does not occur in the highlands although; growth can be good where rainfall is adequate.
Because seeds are edible, they are not usually available for seedling production. When available in the open market, they are usually non-viable because of their short longevity. Consequently seed should be planted immediately.  Adult trees are easily marcotted (air-layered), but only juvenile stem cuttings will root if treated with IBA (20 ppm). Seedlings produced in nurseries and hardened-off before out-planting make the best planting material.
  P. macrophylla is planted on the fringes of compound farms mainly for its edible seed and is a major component of this agroforestry system.
Its empty dry fruit pods are used as fuelwood for cooking. The wood is highly suitable for fuelwood and charcoal making.
Timber:  Wood is used in carving bowls and other household utensils in Nigeria and Ghana.
Tannin or dyestuff:  In Ghana, the ashes from burnt pods are made into a mordant dye.
Lipids: The seed is a source of edible oil, 'the oil bean'.
Medicine:  Crushed seeds taken in case of abortion; leaf and stem decoctions are taken against diarrhoea.
Nitrogen fixing:  P. macrophylla was not known to nodulate until recently.
Ornamental:  In Niger, the tree is a popular ornamental.
Soil improver:  Leaves are shed during the dry season and farmers believe this contributes to soil fertility within the home garden.
Intercropping:  Farmers protect this species on farms because of its open crown form that allows substantial light and does not inhibit crop plants grown under its canopy. This accounts for the trees use in combination with food crops on farms and particularly in home gardens in south east Nigeria."
Persea americana,"Local names:
 Amharic (avocado), Burmese (kyese,htaw bat), Creole (zaboka), English (butter fruit,avocado,avocado-pear,alligator pear), Filipino (avocado), French (avocat,avocatier,zaboka,zabelbok), German (Alligatorbirne,Avocadobirne), Indonesian (avokad,adpukat), Kh
Persea americana is a medium to large tree, 9-20 m in height. The avocado is classified as an evergreen, although some varieties lose their leaves for a short time before flowering. The tree canopy ranges from low, dense and symmetrical to upright and asymmetrical. 

Leaves are 7-41 cm in length and variable in shape (elliptic, oval, lanceolate). They are often pubescent and reddish when young, becoming smooth, leathery, and dark green when mature.

Flowers are yellowish green, and 1-1.3 cm in diameter. The many-flowered inflorescences are borne in a pseudo-terminal position. The central axis of the inflorescence terminates in a shoot. 

The fruit is a berry, consisting of a single large seed, surrounded by a buttery pulp. It contains 3-30% oil (Florida varieties range from 3-15%). The skin is variable in thickness and texture. Fruit colour at maturity is green, black, purple or reddish, depending on variety. Fruit shape ranges from spherical to pyriform, and weigh up to 2.3 kg.
Ecology

West Indian and some hybrid varieties are best adapted to a lowland tropical climate and relatively frost-free areas of the subtropics. Mexican varieties are more cold tolerant and not well adapted to lowland tropical conditions. Guatemalan x Mexican hybrids are generally more cold tolerant than West Indian x Guatemalan hybrid varieties. Some of the more cold-tolerant varieties in Florida include 'Brogdon', 'Gainesville', 'Mexicola', and 'Winter Mexican'. However, it may be difficult to find plants of these varieties. Moderately cold-tolerant types include 'Tonnage', 'Choquette', 'Hall', 'Lula', 'Taylor', 'Monroe', and 'Brookslate'. Varieties with little cold-tolerance include 'Simmonds', 'Pollock', 'Dupuis', 'Nadir', 'Hardee' and 'Waldin'.
Native range
Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, United States of America, Virgin Islands (US)
Tree management

Planting distances depend on soil type and fertility, current technology, and economic factors. In commercial groves, trees are planted from 5-7 m in rows and 7-9 m between rows. Pruning during the first 2 years encourages lateral growth and multiple framework branching. Commercially, after several years of production it is desirable to occasionally reduce canopy width of the trees to 5-6 m, to reduce spraying and harvesting costs and reduce storm damage. Severe topping and hedging do not injure trees. Planned tree removal is an option that should be seriously considered for commercial plantings. 
An avocado tree grown for its fruit production should either be from budded or grafted trees that will produce fruit within 2 or 3 years as compared to the 8-10 or more years required of seedling avocados. The fruit does not generally ripen until it falls or is picked from the tree. Strong winds or a heavy crop easily breaks limbs.
The seeds are recalcitrant; lowest safe mc is 57% mc for slow-drying, 57.4% mc for rapid drying; are only viable for 2-3 weeks after removal of the fruits. Storage is however possible in using several methods such as, 8 months in dry peat at 5 deg. C provided they are not permitted to dry out, or for several months by dusting seeds with copper fungicide and storing in damp sawdust or peat in airtight bags at 4-5 deg. C. A germination percentage of 53-75% was observed after 1 year in moist storage and fungicide at 4.4 deg. C.

Varieties with little cold-tolerance include 'Simmonds', 'Pollock', 'Dupuis', 'Nadir', 'Hardee' and 'Waldin'.
Germination is hypogeal. Most avocado varieties do not come true from seed and must be propagated vegetatively. 
Young, vigorously growing seedlings are used for rootstocks and terminals of leafy shoots are used for scion material. Established trees may be top-worked by cleft-grafting scions of the desired varieties on stumps of cut-back trees or by veneer grafting new sprouts arising from stumped trees. Rootstock plants, which are to be budded or grafted, are usually seedlings 4-8 months old. Scion material for buds or grafts is taken from a mature, bearing tree of the desired variety.
Poison:  The unripe fruit is poisonous and the ground-up seed mixed with cheese is used as a rat and mouse poison.
  The tree is grown for its nutritious fruit that has long been important in the diets of the people of Central America. Consumption is most often as an uncooked savoury dish mixed with herbs and/or spices, as an ingredient of vegetable salads, or as a sweetened dessert. However, its texture and colour can be used to enhance the presentation and consumption of many foods. Cooking impairs flavour and appearance of avocados.  The flesh represents 65-75% of the total fruit weight. The contents vary widely in different cultivars. The approximate content per 100 g of edible portion are: water 65-86 g, protein 1-4 g (unusually high for fruit), fat 5.8-23 g (largely mono-saturated and documented as an anti-cholesterol agent), carbohydrates 3.4-5.7 g (of which sugars only 1 g), iron 0.8-1 g, vitamin A and vitamin B-complex 1.5-3.2 mg. The energy value is 600-800 kJ/100 g. The high oil content of the mature fruit gives the flesh a buttery texture which is neither acid nor sweet. The easily digestible flesh is rich in iron and vitamins A and B; providing a highly nutritious solid food, even for infants.
Surplus fruit is an important food source for pigs and other livestock.
Apiculture:  Bees, important for pollination and honey production, visit the avocado tree.The honey produced is dark  with a heavy body.
Timber:  Wood of Persea has been used for house building (especially for house posts), light construction, furniture, cabinet making, agricultural implements, carving, sculptures, musical instruments, paddles, small articles like pen and brush holders, and novelties. It also yields a good-quality veneer and plywood. More popular for its fruits the wood of avocado is seldom used. The wood is brittle and susceptible to termite attack. 
Lipids:  The pulp and the seeds contain fatty acids, such as oleic, lanolic, palmitic, stearic, linoleic, capric and miristic acid which constitutes 80% of the fruits fatty content. The oil is used by the cosmetic industry in soaps and skin moisturizer products.
Medicine:  Recently anti-cancerous activity has been reported in extracts of leaves and fresh shoots of avocado. Oil extracted from the seeds has astringent properties, and an oral infusion of the leaves is used to treat dysentery. The skin of the fruit has anti-helmintic properties. The avocado is also said to have spasmolitic and abortive properties. The seed is ground and made into an ointment used to treat various skin afflictions, such as scabies, purulent wounds, lesions of the scalp and dandruff. The flesh is also used in traditional medicine. 
Essential oil:  Watery extracts of the avocado leaves contain a yellowish-green essential oil. "
Phoenix dactylifera,"Local names:
 Amharic (yetemir zaf), Arabic (temer,tamar,khuriude-yális,nakhal), Bengali (khajur), Creole (datte), Dutch (dadelpalm), English (wild date palm,date,sugar palm,date palm), French (dattier,dattie,palmier dattier,datte), German (dattelpalme), Hindi (ittapp
Phoenix dactylifera grows to a height of over 30 m; the stem and new leaves grow from the single terminal bud at the stem apex; roots grow from the base of the trunk, sometimes 50 cm above the ground; main roots about 1.5 cm thick.

Leaves enormous, up to 7 m long with a relatively short (50 cm) rachis base or petiole; pinnate, the 50-60 pairs of leaflets long and narrow, attached to a stout central midrib or rachis. They have a normal life of 3-7 years.

Inflorescence is produced in the axil of a 1-year-old leaf; a branched spadix enclosed in a tough spathe that bursts open when the flowers are mature. Male flowers waxy and creamy with 6 stamens and no carpels; female flowers whitish, with 6 rudimentary stamens and 3 carpels.

Fruits are yellow to reddish-brown, each with a single seed up to 2.5 cm long, deeply grooved, with a very hard endosperm. There are hundreds of date cultivars, of which only about 60 are widely grown throughout the 15 major date-growing countries.

‘Phoenix’ is a very old name, used by Theophrastus, indicating that the tree was 1st introduced to the Greeks by the Phoenicians. The specific name derives from the elongated shape of the fruits, resembling the fingers of the hand, from the Greek word ‘dactylos’ (finger), and the Latin word ‘fero’ (I bear).
Ecology

For commercial production, a long summer with high day and night temperatures, a mild winter without prolonged frost, and dry and sunny weather at pollination, flowering and fruit setting are adequate. Its high salt tolerance is largely attributable to its chloride ions exclusion ability during water absorption from saline soils this however reduces growth and results in poor quality fruits.
Native range
Morocco, Palestine
Tree management

After being removed from the mother tree, the trunk suckers must be planted precisely at a spacing of 9-10 m apart in their locations. Watering is essential in the 1st 1 or 2 years, and they must be weeded. Initial growth is slow while the number of leaves increases gradually; the dead leaves are usually removed. Pollination is critical for good fruiting; therefore, pollen is usually artificially introduced to the female flowers by cutting male inflorescence and placing it strategically within the female one, which may be thinned a little to accommodate it. It is important that male trees are planted with females in ratios of about 1:50.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox, with little loss in viability after 1 year of storage at room temperature; viability can be maintained for 8-15 years at room temperature. Seeds tolerate desiccation to 5.8% mc; no loss in viability after 3 years of subsequent hermetic storage. There are approximately 800 seed/kg.

Its high salt tolerance is largely attributable to its chloride ions exclusion ability during water absorption from saline soils this however reduces growth and results in poor quality fruits.
P. dactylifera hardly occurs in the natural state, so natural regeneration cannot be said to occur. Propagation is usually done by trunk suckers, which may be carefully removed from the mother tree. Propagation from seed is done when there are no mature mother trees in the locality; this poses no particular problems but takes longer. The seeds are sown in containers and the young seedlings grown in the nursery for about 1 year before planting out in the field.
Being a halophytic species, P. dactylifera has been used for decades for the revegetation of salt affected lands in the Mediterranean region.
Erosion control:  The leaves are applied in sand dune stabilization.
  The most important use of P. dactylifera is for its fruit, which forms the staple diet of many people in Africa and the Middle East and is as well a cash crop for export. The seeds are roasted and kernels ground as a coffee substitute. Terminal bud leaves are eaten as a vegetable. The sap can be boiled into unrefined sugar.
The seeds (stones) when ground and softened by soaking in water are used for feeding camels, goats and horses and have successfully been substituted as a poultry feed.
The wood can be used as fuelwood.
Fibre:  The leaves are used in mats, ropes, fans and baskets; the petiole yields a fibre, which together with other suitable material is used for insulating boards.
Timber:  The trunks are strong and resistant to termites, providing much valued construction timber.
Shade or shelter:  Old leaves of P. dactylifera are used for thatching.
Medicine:  Dates are a demulcent, an expectorant and a laxative, and are used to treat respiratory diseases and fever. The tree yields a gum used in treating diarrhoea.
Ornamental: The genus Phoenix is one of the most widely cultivated groups of palms, its species being extensively used for bold landscape planting, as individual specimens, for avenue planting, and to a lesser extent, as potted plants.
Dried leaves with their stiff, woody rachis are used for fencing.
Soil improver:  Prunings of leaves are used as manure.
Intercropping:  P. dactylifera while young occupies a lot of space, so a decision to introduce it into cultivated fields must be taken carefully. But once mature, its wide crown grows high above the field crops, and it little affects the yield of cultivated crops. In many places, numerous palms are found in arable fields of suitable regions.
Alcohol:  Wherever fruiting is poor, the sap is the main product. It can be drunk fresh, fermented and drunk as toddy, or distilled and drunk as arrack. The yield of sap varies with management and site conditions, but it is in the range of 4-8 l/day."
Phoenix reclinata,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (kaffer kofie,wildedadelpalm,wildedadelboom,datelboom), Amharic (zembaba,selen), Arabic (wakhale), Bemba (kanchindu,lunchindu), English (mukindu palm,feather palm,false date palm,Senegal palm,coffee palm,wild date palm), French (palmier-dattier
Phoenix reclinata may reach a height of 10-12 m. Stem about 25 cm in diameter, may be straight or curved; sometimes swollen at the base, with a dense mass of pencil-thick roots arising from the lower part. Tree may grow as a stemless suckering bush or with short multiple stems. Bark smooth, black, slightly marked by concentric rings of leaf scars. 

Crown consists of 15-30 live leaves, 10-20 dead and dying ones. Live leaves erect; dead ones hang downwards. Leaves evergreen, pinnate, feather shaped, 3-4 m long, consisting of 100-200 leaflets growing in 2 ranks; leaflets sessile (without stalks), folded, to 30 cm in length, glossy, dark green, long and narrow, with sharp points. The lower 30-50 leaflets very pointed, spinelike, arranged in pairs, the lowest being about 3 cm long.

Small, cream-coloured, stalkless flowers in 20-cm wavy spikes; surrounded by a bright yellow case that opens to let the flowers droop out. Borne in axils of young leaves. Calyx of male flowers cup shaped with 3 petals, 6 stamens, all joined at the base; ovary vestigial, forming large, showy sprays and producing clouds of dustlike pollen; female flowers globose, insignificant, have a calyx as in male, 3 petals, rounded ovary with 3 free carpels, 6 vestigial stamens.

Fruits borne in large, drooping bunches, individual fruit oval, orange to reddish- or yellow-brown, up to 2.5 cm long, fleshy, datelike with a rather insipid but edible flesh.

Closely related to the true date palm, P. dactylifera. ‘Phoenix’ is the Greek word for date palm; it is a very old name used by Theophrastus and indicates that the tree was 1st introduced to the Greeks by the Phoenicians. The specific name, ‘reclinata’, is Latin, meaning ‘bent backwards’, and refers to the leaves.
Ecology

P. reclinata is a clump-forming palm; it may be solitary but is usually found growing in colonies. Grows throughout tropical Africa in humid lowland woodlands, highland forests and on open, rocky hillsides. Occasionally it grows in grasslands with a high water table. Throughout Zambia the species is essentially a swamp or riverine species and is found in considerable concentrations around Lake Bangweulu. It is also found around anthills, on boggy dambos, in munga woodland on the Kafue Flats and in the Kalahari woodland. Outside Zambia its range extends from Senegal across West Africa to Ethiopia, and over the whole of eastern and central Africa to Botswana and the Cape. P. reclinata is drought resistant and prefers full sun but also thrives in light shade. It is a protected species in South Africa.

P. reclinata is drought resistant and prefers full sun but also thrives in light shade. It is a protected species in South Africa.
Trees are propagated from seedlings or suckers. Seed pretreatment is not necessary, and fresh, clean seed germinates easily. Seeds are sown in flat seedling trays filled with a mixture of moist river sand and compost (5:1) and then covered lightly or pressed into the medium with part of the seed still sticking out. Germination occurs within 25-35 days. As soon as the 1st leaf is about 5 cm long seedlings can be transplanted into a bag filled with a mixture of sand and compost (1:1) and later planted out into the open after 1 season in the bag. P. reclinata can also be propagated from suckers taken off adult plants. The growth rate is relatively fast if the plants receive enough water. Trees can withstand light frost but must be protected against cold wind and frost for the first 2 years.
Erosion control:  The tree can be employed in the conservation of soil.
  Buds may be eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable. The heart of the crown is eaten, and the fruit is also edible.
Leaves are eaten by elephants, and the fruit is food for many wild animals.
Wood is suitable for production of charcoal.
Fibre:  Mats, rope, baskets and string can be made from the fibres of young, unexpanded leaves in immature palms, while the midribs of mature leaves are used to make baskets and roofing material. Fibres from the stem are made into brushes and brooms, and in the Cape region of South Africa, leaves are used in making the kilts of Xhosa boys taking part in initiation ceremonies.
Timber:  The wood, which is resistant to white ants and fungi, is used for hut building, making doors, windows and fence posts.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Leaves yield a useful dye, and roots contain tannin.
Medicine:  Parts of the tree are used as a remedy for pleurisy.
Gum or resin:  Roots of P. reclinata yield a gum.
Ornamental:  This palm can be very effective if planted as a specimen tree on a lawn, to line the sides of a road or to fill a large opening in a large garden.
Alcohol:  A palm wine can be brewed from the fermented sap obtained from trees."
Phyllanthus acidus,"Local names:

In north-eastern Brazil, the tree has been found in coastal forest and in Southeast Asia it is cultivated on humid sites, up to 1 000 m altitude.
The country gooseberry is generally grown from seed, but vegetative propagation techniques such as budding, greenwood cuttings, cleft grafting or air layering are also used.
Poison:  Extract from the plant has shown nematicidal activity against the pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. The juice of the root bark is weakly poisonous.
  The mature sour fruits may be eaten fresh but usually they are sprinkled with salt to neutralize the acidity. Used in cooking to flavor dishes, the fruits are excellent raw materials for processing into pickle and sweetened dried fruits; fruit juice is used in cold drinks and fruit to make vinegar. In Malaysia, ripe and unripe fruit are served as a relish, syrup or sweet preserve. The fruits, combined with other fruits are used in chutney or jam, because of their setting properties. Young leaves are cooked as a vegetable in Indonesia, Thailand and India.
The tree is used as fuelwood.
Timber:  The wood is fairly hard, strong, tough and durable if seasoned. It is used for utensils and other small objects.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark is used in India as a tanning agent.
Medicine: The latex is credited with emetic and purgative activity. In Indonesia the bark is heated with coconut oil and spread on eruptions on feet and hands. An infusion of the root is taken to alleviate asthma in Java. In Borneo, roots are used in the treatment of psoriosis of the feet. A leaf decoction is applied to urticaria, a decoction of the bark is used to treat bronchial catarrh in Philippines. The fruit is used as a laxative in Myanmar. In India, the fruits are taken as a liver tonic to enrich the blood."
Quercus floribunda,"Local names:
 English (moru oak,holly oak,green oak), Hindi (tiloj,moru,mohroo), Nepali (thinke,sano phalant,sano pate phalant,phalant,belekharmendo), Trade name (barungi)
Quercus floribunda is a large evergreen tree with a dense crown of shining green foliage, a diameter of up to 1.6 m and a straight bole of up to 45 m long. Bark turning dark grey or dark reddish brown with age and exfoliating in irregular woody scales. The moru oak is the largest of the western Himalayan oaks and it is one of six species of Quercus found in Himalayan regions.

Leaves shiny green, lanceolate to elliptic, 4-8 cm long, acuminate, with the veins branching short of the margin; margin spiny or smooth; leaves hairless beneath.  Margin entire or spinous serrate, coriaceous, glabrous when mature.

Male catkins crowded, drooping, lax, up to 7.5 cm long, bracts lanceolate. Female spikes short, to 4 cm long, styles 3-5, linear-clavate.

Fruit an acorn, solitary on previous year’s shoots, ovoid or oblong, with a fine point, about twice as long as the cup, about 2 cm long, brown.
Ecology

Its natural range of distribution is the temperate region of the western Himalayas from Nepal westwards at altitudes of 2100-2700 m, descending to about 1700 m in cool moist areas. Although found on all aspects, it avoids very dry situations and favours moist, cool locations on northerly aspects with deep and fertile soil  but on shallow gravelly soils, the tree is stunted. It tends to regenerate in dense pure patches, and to grow gregariously in crops of varying extent. It is frequently found scattered in mixtures with coniferous and broad-leaved trees.  It is frost-hardy but does not tolerate drought.
Native range
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan
Tree management

Q. floribunda tolerates shade, coppices well, grows without a massive root system and, therefore, is not wind firm. Under natural conditions seed germinates well soon after falling during and after the summer rains from August to October. It is planted at a spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m for production of clean stems, as the tree tends to develop strong branches. Seedlings are drought sensitive and growth is moderately fast. A number of insect and fungal pests attack this species. In Jaunsar in India plantations (direct sown) averaged 4.3 m in height after 20 years, which is slow. It tolerates side shade when young, but growth of older trees is better in the open.  Best growth is on well-drained clay loam, and on shallow gravelly soils growth becomes stunted.  The tree is frost-hardy, but early frosts sometimes kill the seedlings.  It does not tolerate drought.  It coppices well, until the tree is about 10 cm in diameter; trees larger than this coppice poorly in many localities.
The seed ripens between August and October, and under natural conditions germinates soon after falling.  In a good seed year abundant young natural seedlings will be found near to the seed-bearers, but many may die off during the next dry season, if exposed to the sun.  In moist shady places dense thickets of seedlings may develop. Seed storage is intermediate and seeds weigh 500-600 seeds/kg.  When stored in sealed tins under cool dry conditions, it can remain viable for up to one year.

It tends to regenerate in dense pure patches, and to grow gregariously in crops of varying extent. It is frequently found scattered in mixtures with coniferous and broad-leaved trees.  It is frost-hardy but does not tolerate drought.
This species can be cultivated successfully either by direct sowing or by transplanting from the nursery. Germination under nursery conditions commences in about 10-14 days and is complete in 5-6 weeks. Seedlings are ready for planting out in about 2 years. Its forests are worked, along with its coniferous associates, under selection felling. However, in view of its natural tendency to regenerate in even-aged masses, the concentrated working and system of successive regeneration felling would be preferable to selection working.
Fodder: Young plants and coppice shoots are readily browsed, particularly by goats. Leaves contain 9.6% crude protein, with a digestibility coefficient of 44%.  The total digestible nutrients are 43.2. The trees are extensively lopped for fodder.
It is a good fuelwood and is used for making charcoal.
Timber:  Sapwood thin, grey while heartwood is russet to pale greyish brown with darker streaks, very hard, strong and heavy (wood weighs about 970 kg/cu. m). It has a straight grain but uneven texture, is difficult to season and work. In the western Himalayas, it is used for structural building construction, railway sleepers, dunnage pallets, tool handles, heavy-duty flooring, agricultural implements and door and window frames as well as for fuel and charcoal.
Tannin or Dyestuffs: Leaves contain up to 9.8 % tannin and have been recommended as a source of tannin material."
Quercus glauca,"Local names:
 Chinese (qing gang li), English (ring cupped oak,blue japanese oak,bamboo-leaved oak), German (bambusblättrige eiche), Italian (quercia a foglie di bamboo), Nepali (sano phalant,sano pate phalant,banjh)
Q. glauca is a medium-sized (up to 20 m), attractive broadleaf evergreen tree, with an oval, rounded crown and a clear, cylindrical bole. 
Leaves alternate, simple, evergreen, oblong, elliptic, to obovate-oblong , 7-13 cm long, 2.5-6 cm wide, abruptly acuminate. Margin serrate on the upper half. Lamina glabrous and glossy green above, glaucous and silky hairy beneath.  New foliage is either a rich green or bronze to purple-green. Very handsome when  the new foliage emerges which usually occurs in early.

Fruit a corn, 1 to 3 in a cluster, enclosed 1/3 in a downy cap with 6 to 7 raised 
concentric rings, ripens in one year. Acorns ovoid, 2 cm long, maturing (rarely in Europe) in one year.
Ecology

It occurs in secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest communities in north subtropical and warmer temperate zones of Asia, at elevations from 300-3100 m. It prefers moist, cool locations with good illumination, but can grow on a variety of soils. Slightly saline loams and neutral limestone soils promote the best growth, with pure stands occurring on deep, moist clays underlain with sandstone and shale. Q. glauca can withstand considerable shade up to the pole stage, but thereafter requires complete overhead illumination.
Native range
China, India, Japan, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam
Tree management

Q. glauca is propagated either by direct sowing or by planting nursery-raised seedlings. 
The seedlings are tolerant to shade, but older trees benefit from full light; seedlings are sensitive to frost and must be protected during the winter, but older trees are more frost-resistant.  The tree prefers moist situations, such as north aspects and the sides of the ravines, and grows well on deep clay loams.  It should not be planted on dry sites.  The seedlings are liable to be browsed. Natural stands reach a height of 9.8-11.2 m and 9.8-12.5 cm d.b.h. after 25 years, with a standing volume of 80-92 cubic m per ha. . Managed plantations grow faster and can attain 8 m and 7.5 cm d.b.h. after 14 years. The tree coppices freely. Bare-root planting has given very poor results.
The seed ripens between October and December, according to the locality.  The number of seeds per kg varies from 500-1900. In most localities the seedlings will need about 15 months in the nursery to reach a height of 15 cm.

Q. glauca can withstand considerable shade up to the pole stage, but thereafter requires complete overhead illumination.
The recalcitrant seeds quickly lose viability if allowed to dry out. 
It can be stored moist and cool over winter but is best sown as soon as it is ripe in an outdoor seed bed, though it must be protected from mice, squirrels etc. Small quantities of seed can be sown in deep pots in a cold frame. Plants produce a deep taproot and need to be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible, in fact seed sown in situ will produce the best trees. Trees should not be left in a nursery bed for more than 2 growing seasons without being moved or they will transplant very badly.
 Seeds, raw or cooked have a sweet taste. The seed can be dried, ground into a powder and used as a thickening in stews etc or mixed with cereals for making bread. If the seed contains bitter tannins, these can be leached out by thoroughly washing the seed in running water though many minerals will also be lost. Either the whole seed can be used or the seed can be dried and ground it into a powder. It can take several days or even weeks to properly leach whole seeds, one method was to wrap them in a cloth bag and place them in a stream. Leaching the powder is quicker. A simple taste test can tell when the tannin has been leached. The traditional method of preparing the seed was to bury it in boggy ground overwinter. The germinating seed was dug up in the spring when it would have lost most of its astringency. The leaves are cooked as a famine food. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.
Timber: The wood is a good quality timber with a fine texture and straight grain. The specific gravity is about 0.89 g/cubic cm. The wood is hard, fairly durable and used for heavy and light construction purposes, railway sleepers, posts, stakes, poles, making containers and furniture and as fuelwood.
Tannin or Dyestuffs: Oak galls are excrescences that are sometimes produced in great numbers on the tree and are caused by the activity of the larvae of different insects. The insects live inside these galls, obtaining their nutrient therein. When the insect pupates and leaves, the gall can be used as a rich source of tannin, that can also be used as a dyestuff.
Medicine: It has been used in traditional medicine as an astringent treatment for haemorrhoids.
Ornamental: This tree often used as a residential shade tree
Other services: This tree is recommended for buffer strips around  parking lots or for median strip plantings in the highway. The branches and twigs are good material for culturing mushrooms (for example, Pleurotus eryngii)."
Quercus humboldtii,"Local names:
 English (South American oak,Colombian oak), Spanish (roble negro,roble blanco,roble amarillo,roble)
Quercus humboldtii is predominantly evergreen tree to 25 m and a diameter to 1 m with buttresses to 1 m. The bark red/grey or grey, fissured, breaking into squares and flaking.

Leaves simple, alternate, lanceolate, 10-20 cm long, clustered at the end of the branches; lamina leathery and glabrous, apex acute, base cuneate, shiny green above, lighter green beneath.

Flowers yellow, small, unisexual; inflorescence a raceme; male flowers numerous, feminine ones in a cupula, styles long. 

Fruit light brown, ovoid capsule (acorn) with leathery pericarp, 2-2.5 cm in diameter and 5-7 cm long, resting on a scaly cupule. Only one fruit per cupule is developed, inside of acorn shell woolly.
Ecology

It is light demanding and often dominates competing species. In Colombia it is associated with Hedyosmum huilense, Clethra fagifolia and Billia columbiana in mid-zone forest.
Native range
Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela
Tree management

The seedlings and saplings must not be exposed to direct sunlight. Planting density should be about 380 trees/ha. Maximum commercial value is reached after 35 years, yielding  400 m3 of wood/ha.
The fruits should be collected directly from the tree or by shaking the branches, as fresh fruits will have better viability and are less susceptible to attack by arthropods, worms, birds and rodents. The seed has a very limited capacity of dispersal due to its large size.

The seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant. The fresh fruits have a moisture content of about 21%. The seeds can be stored for about four months in a cold and dry place with good aeration. Storage at humidity above 12% may result in premature germination or deterioration. Good results have been achieved by storing the fruits in water at low temperatures or in humid sand, moss or sawdust and kept under observation for insect or fungal attacks. There are 210-250 seeds/kg.
It is light demanding and often dominates competing species. In Colombia it is associated with Hedyosmum huilense, Clethra fagifolia and Billia columbiana in mid-zone forest.
Propagation is usually by seeds, root suckers and cuttings. Seed sowing should be done immediately after the fruits have been washed, and the sowing beds irrigated. The seeds can be sown directly in beds, or better in large bags, 20 x 30 cm. Sowing depth should equal the diameter of the fruit and the sowing distance 5 x 5 cm. It is advisable to use soil taken from a natural oakwood forest. Germination lasts 60-65 days. The seedlings can be transplanted to the field when they reach a height of 60-80 cm.

Vegetative propagation can be done from the bare roots, root suckers, root stocks or cuttings. It has a great capacity for coppicing and it is advisable to cut 30-35 cm from the ground to obtain good shoots. A tree with a small diameter can produce as many shoots as a large one but the shooting capacity is lost when the tree reaches a diameter of more than 50 cm. Natural regeneration is prolific when there is a layer of moist humus on the forest floor. They develop in total shade satisfactorily, but later, due to lack of light and the competition with the smaller vegetation, a great number of them die.
In the mid-Andean montane region of Colombia, reforestation programmes use the native species for revegetation such as Quercus humboldtii, Billia columbiana, Alnus acuminata and Beilschmiedia sulcata.
 The acorns are nutritious but, unlike the white oaks, are bitter. They serve as an important food for wildlife. If it is to be used as human food, then the acorns should be boiled repeatedly to get rid of the bitterness as the natives Americans did.
It produces good firewood and charcoal.
Timber: The wood is hard and heavy, easy to work, with a smooth finish. Wood density is 0.9-1.0 grams/cm³. Suitable for poles, tool handles, rollers and exterior use in general. 
Ornamental: It’s a good ornamental plant especially along the road.

Quercus semecarpifolia is a middle to a large gregarious, evergreen to nearly evergreen tree, forming a long clean bole, attaining a height of 24-30 m and a girth of 210 cm or more under favourable conditions.  The larger trees are generally hollow, with young parts clothed with soft hairs. Bark dark grey, rough, cracked into more or less rectangular scales.

Leaves 5-12 x 2.5-7.5 cm, elliptic or oblong, spinous-toothed in young trees, often entire on older trees, stiffy, coriaceous, glabrous and dark-green above, generally rusty-tomentose beneath, lateral nerves 6-12 pairs, bifurcating, impressed above, base cordate or rounded.  The new leaves, subtended by brown deciduous stipules, are bright green above, with a felty light brown, nearly white beneath.  The branches are often festooned with mosses and lichens.

Male catkins crowded, 5-10 cm long and congested in seed years, 10-20 cm long in other years.  The male catkins and female spikes appear in dense pendulous clusters on the new shoots. Perianth ciliate, stamens indefinite.  

Acorn solitary, in pairs or in clusters of 3-6 on previous year’s shoots, 2.5 cm diameter, globose, black when ripe, cup soft and leathery, enclosing about a third of the nut, scales green with reddish brown tips.
Ecology

The tree is found throughout the Himalayas from Bhutan westwards, mainly between 2400 and 3000 m elevation, occasionally descending to about 2000 m and ascending up to about 3600 m elevation on northern and southern aspects respectively.  It also occurs in east Manipur bordering Burma between about 2400 and 3000 m elevation. Within its well marked zone, it occurs gregariously, forming stands along the tops and upper slopes of ridges.  It is frequently mixed with spruce (Picea smithiana), Silver fir (Abies pindrow) or yew (Taxus baccata) and in some localities with blue pine (Pinus wallichiana).  Among the broad-leaved species, common associates are Pyrus spp, Prunus padus, Acer caesium, Juglans regia, Betula alnoides etc.  It is a characteristic tree of West Himalayan upper oak/fir forest and Kharsu oak forest types, generally predominating on the exposed ridges.

Tree management

This oak can be raised either by direct sowing or by planting out nursery raised seedlings. Slow growth, heavy grazing and dense growth of weeds hamper its establishment.  For the establishment of natural reproduction, abundant overhead light is essential and often, dense thickets of young oak come up near the isolated mother trees or on the edge of stands, where the canopy is opened out.

For raising nursery seedlings, sowing is done in July, in lines 20cm apart and about 2cm deep.  Seed from fresh collection should only be used.  The nursery is irrigated and weeded regularly.  During the following summer, the seedlings are spaced about 10 cm in lines.  2 year-old seedlings are planted out with balls of earth in July-August in 30 cm³ pits.  Spacing for the plantation may be 2.5m x 2.5m. Winter planting is not successful. Bagged plants can also be used. This oak is a light-demander and fails to establish under shade.  It coppices and pollards fairly well, the latter in particular are liable to snow-break.  Out of the large number of coppice shoots, a few eventually survive and the remainder are suppressed.  The growth of coppice-shoots is slow. Young pole and tree may also suffer from load of snow and get uprooted. Young growth is susceptible to fire also.
The seeds of this genus are recalcitrant. The germination under favourable conditions is prolific. It seeds profusely every second or third year, twelve years of record of seeding showed abundant seeding in four years, and poor to moderate seeing in eight years. Ripe acorns should be collected from the trees as the seed lots collected from the forest floor contain fairly large number of insect damaged acorns.  The seed should be carefully selected as the spikes contain various degrees of green to ripen seeds.  The acorns should be dried in shade and kept in a cool place.  About 140 acorns weigh 1 kg.  The fresh seed has a high fertility of about 95-100 percent, but retains vitality for a short time. Q.semecarpifolia quickly loses viability if it is allowed to dry out. It can be stored moist and cool over winter but is best sown as soon as it is ripe in an outdoor seed bed, though it must be protected from mice, squirrels etc.
The tree is found throughout the Himalayas from Bhutan westwards, mainly between 2400 and 3000 m elevation, occasionally descending to about 2000 m and ascending up to about 3600 m elevation on northern and southern aspects respectively.  It also occurs in east Manipur bordering Burma between about 2400 and 3000 m elevation. Within its well marked zone, it occurs gregariously, forming stands along the tops and upper slopes of ridges.

Under natural conditions, the germination takes place early in the rainy season.  The nuts fall as soon as they ripen and germinate immediately, some even showing signs of germination before falling.

Direct sowing has been practiced in India successfully.  Sowing is done in lines about 3 m apart.  The lines are kept free of weeds and the shade of neighbouring bushes.  It is necessary to have the contour lines prepared in advance and to sow the seed as soon as it ripens. The sowing area should be fairly open. Small quantities of seed can be sown in deep pots in a cold frame. Germination is hypogeous.  Plants produce a deep taproot and need to be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible, in fact seed sown in situ will produce the best trees. Trees should not be left in a nursery bed for more than 2 growing seasons without being moved or they will not transplant properly. The rate of growth of seedlings is very slow, averaging only about 5-10 cm in height during the first few years. They normally die back every year for 2-3 years, sending up new and stronger shoots each year until they finally commence upward growth. However, when artificially grown below their natural elevation, the seedlings produce normal foliage leaves in the first season and do not die back.
 Seeds can be dried, ground into a powder and used as a thickening in stews etc or mixed with cereals for making bread. The seed contains bitter tannins, these can be leached out by thoroughly washing the seed in running water though many minerals will also be lost. Either the whole seed can be used or the seed can be dried and ground it into a powder. It can take several days or even weeks to properly leach whole seeds, one method was to wrap them in a cloth bag and place them in a stream. Leaching the powder is quicker. A simple taste test can tell when the tannin has been leached. The traditional method of preparing the seed was to bury it in boggy ground over winter. The germinating seed was dug up in the spring when it would have lost most of its astringency.
The tree is lopped extensively in the hills of Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.  Bears are particularly fond of acorns.  The rotation lopping cycle is 3-4 year for maintenance of good health to lopped trees as they are capable of living to good old age and remain productive for very long periods.
It makes good firewood and excellent charcoal; the calorific value of sapwood is 4879 k cal and of heartwood 4815 k call/kg of dry wood.
Timber: Heartwood reddish-grey, very hard, annual rings not very distinct.  Weight 850 kg/cum.  The wood splits on seasoning.  It is used only locally for building, door-frames, beds steads, ploughs and mule-saddles.  Wood is also used as a substitute for imported oak for kegs in distilleries.  
Tannin or Dyestuffs: Oak galls are excrescences that are sometimes produced in great numbers on the tree and are caused by the activity of the larvae of different insects. The insects live inside these galls, obtaining their nutrient therein. When the insect pupates and leaves, the gall can be used as a rich source of tannin that can also be used as a dyestuff.
Other services: A mulch of the leaves repels slugs, grubs etc, though fresh leaves should not be used as these can inhibit plant growth. Silkworms of Antheraea proylei is widely cultivated on the leaves of oaks, of which the leaves of Q. semecarpifolia ar"

The generic name Rauvolfia (sometimes mis-spelt Rauwolfia), commemorates a 16th century German physician, Leonhart Rauvolf, who travelled widely to collect medicinal plants.  The specific name ‘caffra’ means ‘of Kaffraria’ (Eastern Cape). The common name ‘quinine tree’ refers to the bitter and supposedly quinine-like properties of the bark.
Ecology

Naturally distributed from Tanzania to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Occurring near rivers and streams. When growing away from rivers and streams it is always associated with available ground water, therefore regarded as an indicator of water. R. caffra is a frost sensitive species.
Native range
Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Seedlings and young plants transfer well. Give them sufficient water for the first 3 months until they are established. It has a fast growth rate, up to 1.5 m/year. The tree is a shade demander especially when very young. However, as the tree grows older its light requirement changes. The old trees do not tolerate shade. Unfortunately its large size and invasive root system make it unsuitable for the smaller garden.

R. caffra regenerates naturally from coppice, suckers and seed. The seed germinates after staying on the forest floor for quite a long time. 
The tree grows easily from seed, cuttings or truncheons. Collect fruit and make sure that the pulp is removed, wash with water and sow in seedling trays filled with a mixture of river sand and compost (1:1). Press the seeds into the mixture until they are flush with the surface. A thin layer of sand over the seeds is optional. Transplant the seedlings into nursery bags when they reach the 3-leaf stage.
Leaves browsed by nyala, and the leaves, flowers and fruit eaten by vervet monkeys.
Apiculture:  It is an important species in bee keeping. 
The tree is a good source of fuel.
Timber:  Wood is yellowish-white with a small heartwood, soft and light (air-dry 540 kg/m³). It is suitable for general timber work and takes nails well. An excellent wood for making fruit boxes and is ideal for kitchen furniture and shelving. Household utensils are sometimes carved from this wood. 
Shade or shelter:  It is used as a shade tree in coffee plantations.
Medicine:  The pharmacological studies of the plant show it to be an anti-depressant; it has sedative action and an anti-hypertensive effect accompanied by brachycardia. R. caffra alkaloid (resperine) exerts important effects on behaviour and on autonomic functions, and has been very useful in the treatment of hypertension and psychoses. The root of the plant is traditionally used for treating insomnia and insecurity. A bark decoction is drunk for general body swellings, rheumatism and pneumonia. The stem and root bark can be used as an ascaricide and the powdered unopened inflorescence as a local application to sores on the legs. The root juice, mixed with honey, is applied to fractures. The bark has been used as an astringent and as a colic remedy. The root bark is dried and ground or pounded while fresh and an infusion prepared for the remedy of roundworms and tapeworm. It also acts as a purgative and/or an emetic. The bark is used as a cure for coughs and toothaches.
Ornamental:  This is a fine, fast-growing tree for sheltered gardens, easily raised from seed and unusually decorative.
Alcohol:  The root and stem bark is added to a local alcoholic beverage made from banana to increase the potency of the drink"
Rauvolfia vomitoria,"Local names:
 English (swizzle stick), Yoruba (asofeyeje)
Rauvolfia vomitoria is a shrub or small tree up to 8 m. Older parts of the plant contain no latex. The branches are whorled and the nodes enlarged and lumpy.

Leaves in threes, elliptic-acuminate to broadly lanceolate.

Flowers are minute, sweet-scented, branches of inflorescences are distinctly puberulous with hardly any free corolla lobes.

Fruits are fleshy and red in colour.

The generic name Rauvolfia (sometimes mis-spelt Rauwolfia), commemorates a 16th century German physician, Leonhart Rauvolf, who travelled widely to collect medicinal plants. The specific epithet vomitoria refers to the purgative and emetic properties of the bark.
Ecology

Occurs naturally in gallery forests but is mostly found in forest regrowth where fallow periods are prolonged. R. vomitoria is associated with palms, Trema guineensis and Combretum spp., and is one of the last species to disappear in this particular seral stage. R. vomitoria is considered endangered.
Native range

R. vomitoria is associated with palms, Trema guineensis and Combretum spp., and is one of the last species to disappear in this particular seral stage. R. vomitoria is considered endangered.
Wild seedlings are successfully transplanted and cultivated. Propagation by cuttings is possible. Natural stump regrowth is possible in this species. It can be propagated vegetatively using single-node, leafy stem cuttings or root cuttings treated with NAA, Indole Butyric acid and Giberrelic acid at 50, 100 or 150 p.p.m. alone and in all combinations (1:1 ratio).
Poison:  The members of this family usually have toxic properties. In Gabon, the bark and root powder, are mixed with water or palm oil to kill fleas and vermin. The root bark extracts are reportedly poisonous.
Not a preferred browse species, crude protein content 9.3% (Mecha et al. 1980).
Apiculture:  The sweet-scented flowers are frequented by bees.
Used as firewood for instance in Sierra Leone.
Fibre:  R.vomitoria bark yields a good bast fibre.
Timber: Kakapenpen yields a white and fine grained wood which reddens with age and has a fairly hard heartwood. This wood is a substitute for boxwood.
Shade or shelter:  A good shade provider.
Tannin or dyestuff:  A yellow dye is obtained from the bark.
Medicine:  This tree is used medicinally in many African countries. R. vomitoria is used by Nigerian traditional healers to treat psychiatric patients. The dried root of R. vomitoria, administered orally at (doses of 400, 600 or 800 mg/day), showed antipsychotic effects. Overall side effects are minimal. R. vomitoria is used to treat leprosy in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The seed extract is procured for general ilness. Amyrin palmitate, present in a Ghanaian antiarthritic herbal preparation with R. vomitoria has curative properties. The bark has purgative and emetic properties. The root extracts have arbotifacient properties.
Nitrogen fixing:  Forms root nodules with vesicular arbiscular mycorrhiza.
Ornamental:  Widely planted as an ornamental and avenue tree.
It is suitable for live fences. The pliable branches are used to support bird traps.
Intercropping:  The tree is a wild host of the pathogen causing ‘collar crack’ of cacao. Despite these reports it is used as a shade bearer for young cacao trees and as a support for vanilla in Gabon. 
Latex or rubber:  A latex exudes from the young stems.
Other services:  In Ivory Coast, the ‘Serpent Sect’ of the Man region consider the plant fetish. The young twigs with the side branches trimmed short serve as mixers for drinks, hence the English name swizzle stick."
Rhamnus prinoides,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (hondepishout,blinkblaar), Amharic (gesho), English (shiny leaf,dog wood,dark blinkblaar), Tigrigna (ghesho,gesho), Xhosa (umGlindi), Zulu (umNyenye,umHlinye,umGilindi)
Rhamnus prinoides is a shrub sometimes with the tendency to scramble, or a small, dense, thick, bushy evergreen tree that may reach 9 m in height; usually spineless, with no buttresses; branchlets pubescent when young, glabrous when mature; bark grey to brown, smooth, with conspicuous lenticels, becoming dark brown with age.

Leaves alternate, simple, not deciduous, elliptic to oblong elliptic, 2.5-10 x 1.5-5 cm; young leaves light green, mature leaves very glossy dark green on the topside, dull green on the underside, without hairs; apex rather narrowly tapering; base tapering to rounded; margin finely toothed or scalloped over the upper portion; nerves sunken on top and on the underside, prominently reticulate on top; petiole 3-10 mm long; stipules small, caducous or persistent.

Flowers greenish-yellow, small, pentamerous, inconspicuous, on slender stalks, in sparse axillary groups or clusters of 2-10, in the axils of the leaves; petals greenish; pedicels up to 1.9 cm long; ovary 3-4 celled.

Fruits are berrylike (drupe), ovoid to almost circular, about 5 mm in diameter, shiny red becoming dark red when mature, sometimes almost black, usually clearly divided into 3 compartments, with a small saucer-shaped calyx, 3-seeded; stalk thin.

The generic name ‘Rhamnus’ is a Greek word meaning a ‘tuft of branches’, and the specific name ‘prinoides’ means ‘resembling prinos’, which is an evergreen oak. This species seems to be related to a number of Indian species, including R. arnottianus.
Ecology

R. prinoides is widespread and locally common at medium to high altitudes, along water courses, in riverine forest and at the margins of evergreen forests. It grows in afro-montane rainforests, undifferentiated afro-montane forests (mixed Podocarpus forest, Juniperus-Podocarpus forest), and dry, single-dominant afro-montane forest (Juniperus and Juniperus-Olea forest), especially in clearings and along edges; also in secondary, montane evergreen forests and mountain slopes, frequently among rocks.

It stretches from about Swellendum through eastern Cape, Orange Free State and Lesotho to the Transkei, Natal, Swaziland, and eastern and northeastern Transvaal, and northwards through tropical Africa to Ethiopia. Often in the high, grassy, cold country of the northeastern Cape, this little tree is conspicuous. It grows in big numbers, among other places, between Mt Fletcher and Maclear and in Natal between Estcourt and Giant’s Castle, where it is dominant over a section of the countryside. On grassy hillsides the tree often appears quite black, or at times it glitters in the sun so conspicuously that it can be distinguished at a distance by this aspect alone. It shares this character with 2 other trees, Olea africana and Bequaertiodendron magalismontanum. The tree casts so deep a shade that it often prevents other growth around it. It can withstand a fair amount of frost and grows well in light shade under trees and equally well in full sun.
Native range
Botswana, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda
Tree management

Plants in containers grow well and with constant pruning will form a dense bush. Growth rate is fast at about 1 m/year. Trees planted in dry areas without additional water will grow far more slowly than the plants in high-rainfall areas.
Fresh seed is collected from the tree. The fleshy part is then removed (it contains a growth inhibitor) and the seeds are dried in the shade. Seed storage behaviour of Rhamnus species is orthodox; 3% germination followed 12 years of air-dry storage at 40% rh and 4 deg. C. There about 60 000 seeds/kg.

It can withstand a fair amount of frost and grows well in light shade under trees and equally well in full sun.
The trees are easily grown from seeds, which germinate readily, and the hardy seedlings can be obtained from many nurseries. Most of the seeds germinate, taking from 2-6 weeks, with some still germinating after 8 weeks. Germination rate is usually 80-90%.
Erosion control:  A good tree to plant along drainage lines or furrows to protect stream banks.
  Fruits are edible.
Timber:  The wood is white to yellow, often streaked with brown, pink, red or green; it is hard and heavy but usually not hard enough to make anything but small articles.
Shade or shelter:  R. prinoides can be planted as a hedge along camp fences or along the edges of crops to act as a low windbreak. It may also be planted by fishponds to protect and shade the fish.
Medicine:  A decoction of the root is taken as a blood purifier, to treat pneumonia, gonorrhoea rheumatism and stomach-ache and as a gargle. The leaves are applied as a liniment to simple sprains. Leaf decoction may be mixed with the bark of Erythrina abyssinica to alleviate colic.
Ornamental:  The attractive leaves and berries make striking floral arrangements, and because it grows slowly and has a non-aggressive root system, it is perfect for a small garden. It is easily grown and can be trained in various bonsai styles.
R. prinoides can be used effectively as a hedge or screen plant in the garden."
Rhizophora mucronata,"Local names:
 Burmese (pyoo), English (true mangrove), Filipino (bakßuan), Indonesian (bakau bakau hitam), Javanese (dyankar,bako), Malay (bakau hitam,bakau kurap,bakau jangkar), Thai (phangka,kongkang,kon gkang bai yai), Trade name (true mangrove,bakauan), Vietnamese
Rhizophora mucronata is a tree up to 27(-30) m tall and with trunk 50-70 cm in diameter; taproot usually abortive; lateral roots numerous, developed from base of the trunk, much branched, usually called stilt roots, hoop or pile-like, supporting the tree; hanging air-roots are sometimes also produced from the lower branches; stem in closed forest cylindrical, or developing a straggling or semi-prostrate habit especially in unfavourable conditions; bark almost black or reddish, rough or sometimes scaly, with prominent, horizontal cracks almost encircling the stem.    

Leaves leatherly, broadly elliptic to oblong-elliptic, (8.5-)11-18(-23) cm x 5-10.5(-15) cm, with very distinct black dots on the undersurface, tapered at both ends and tipped with a fine spine, glossy green above and paler beneath; petiole 2.5-5.5 cm long; stipules large, 5.5-8.5 cm long, pinkish or reddish, sticky.

Inflorescences axillary, 2 or 3 times forked, rather loosely (1-)3-5(-12)-flowered; peduncles 2.5-5 cm long; flowers with 4-8 mm long pedicels and united, cup-shaped bracteoles at the base; calyx deeply lobed, 13-19 mm long, pale yellow or almost white; petals lanceolate, 9 mm long, light yellowish, densely hairy along the margins, sparsely hairy on the back; stamens 8, sessile, equal, anthers 6-8 mm long; ovary semi-inferior, free part high conical, 2.5-3 mm high, style very short, 0.5-1.5 mm long, obscurely 2-lobed.

Mature fruit an elongately ovoid berry, 5-7 cm x 2.5-3.5 cm with hardly contracted apex and often rugose base, dull brown-green.

Seedlings with cotyledons 2-4 cm protruding from the fruit; hypocotyls hanging, cylindrical, 36-64(-over 100) cm x 1.8-2.5 cm, tuberculate, usually straight, gradually narrowed upwards into a hard, shrap point.

One should keep in mind that, at least in Malesia, botanical information on R. mucronata can often also be applied to a closely allied, also common, widely distributed species R. apiculata Blume.  The latter species can be distinguished from R. mucronata in the field by some easily observed characters.  The bark is grey, almost smooth, with vertical fissures.  Inflorescences are shorter, fork only once, and are always 2-flowered.  Seedling hypocotyls are usually less than 30 cm long, smooth.  In western Malaysia and west from New Guinea a few specimens occur with characters intermediate between R. mucronata, R. apiculata and a third species, R. stylosa Griffith.  Hybridization might occur in nature between these species.
Ecology

Plants of R. mucronata are most profusely developed, generally gregariously, on the banks of tidal creeks, in estuaries and on low coastal areas flooded by normal, daily, high tides.  The trees of this species form a rather uniform, evergreen fringe to the mangrove forest.  In certain favourable regions in Malesia they may occupy considerable large areas, sometimes associated with R. apiculata, sometimes forming almost pure stands.  Communities of the two common species of Rhizophora can sometimes be identified at a glance by their different shades of green.
Native range
Australia, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Philippines
Tree management

The tree grows slowly.  In Peninsular Malaysia it takes 35-40 years to reach up to 19 cm in diameter.  A 40-years rotation is favourable. For tannin production the bark is removed by hand from living trees or from trees just felled for firewood, charcoal or timber. Its yield of bark is 23-27% of the volume or 18-20% of the weight.

Natural regeneration always occurs near mature trees.  There is a form of vegetative spread of the trees by horizontal growth of the lower branches supported by stilt roots; these branches can continue to grow if the parent trunk dies.  Young seedlings can be used for planting.
The trees are important for producing good quality charcoal and for firewood.  A great advantage of Rhizophora L. in the eyes of firewood dealers is that it can easily be split.
Timber: The wood shows a beautiful silver grain on radial section and the heartwood is dark orange-red. The use of the wood is limited because of its light weight, poor durability and small size of the trunk.
Tannin or dyestuff: In the Malesian Archipelago, the bark of mangrove trees (Chiefly R. mucronata and/or R. apiculata Blume) is an important source of tannin.  It is used for tanning leather and to toughen and dye lines, nets, and ropes used by fishermen.  According to laboratory investigations, mangrove tannin extracted from the bark could be used to produce adhesive for the manufacture of plywood and particle board.
Medicine: It is used also occasionally as medicine in cases of haematuria.
Soil improver: The bark, according to some chemical analyses, appears to contain mainly of lime (18%) and calcium carbonate (70%), and can be used as fertilizer.  
Other services: The trees are also used for fish-traps."
Rhododendron arboreum,"Local names:
 English (rose tree,rhododendron), Nepali (lali gurans), Trade name (chalan)
Rhododendron arboreum is one of the most stately and impressive rhododendron species. It is extremely variable in stature, hardiness, flower color and leaf characteristics. Originally discovered in north-central India, the plant known locally as Lali Guras is the tallest of Nepal’s rhododendrons, reaching heights of more than 20m. It has the largest trunk and flowers, blossoming earlier and longer than the others. 
 In its native land, huge trees of R. arboreum grow to a height of 25m or more.
Trunk often much branched, crooked or gnarled. Bark reddish brown, soft and rough, exfoliating in thin flakes.
 
The foliage of R. arboreum is extremely handsome. Its thick, stiff, leathery dark green leaves are covered on the under surface with a thin layer of indumentum ranging in color from silver to fawn to deep cinnamon, elegant in foliage. Leaves glossy green, oblong-lanceolate, 10-20 cm long and 3.6 cm wide. Crowded towards the ends of branches, petiole covered with white scales when young.

The flowers of R. arboreum range in color from a deep scarlet, to red with white markings, to pink to white. Bearing up to twenty blossoms in a single truss this rhododendron is a spectacular sight when in full bloom. It is reported that the bright red forms of this rhododendron are generally found at the lower elevations.

Fruit a capsule, oblong, curved, longitudinally ribbed, up to 3.8 cm long and 1.25 cm wide.

Seeds minute, dark brown, compressed, oblong.

Three varieties are recognized, var. cinnamomum is a small tree with smaller leaves and white, pale rose or purple spotted flowers and occurs in Nepal and northern Bengal.

R. arboreum in the world’s most famous rhododendron. This spectacular plant was designated the national flower of Nepal, the legendary home of Mt. Everest and other mountain gods. It’s even depicted on the national coat of arms.
Ecology

R. arboreum is found in many vegetation types, and sometimes forms almost pure forest in restricted areas. It is common in the western Himalayas in association with Quercus species and Pinus roxburghii. It thrives best on moist loam although it is also found on moist rocky ground. The tree can withstand shading although it develops better in the open.
Native range
Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan
Tree management

It coppices well but is a slow growing tree.
There are about 12 million seeds/kg. They are extracted by drying the capsules on paper in the sun.

The tree can withstand shading although it develops better in the open.
R. arboreum can be raised from seed although propagation is mainly through cuttings and wildings. Seedlings can be raised artificially in containers filled with fine sand; the seed should not be covered. They are pricked out at the 2-leaf stage. Young seedlings should be kept under shade.  Seeds are best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn and given artificial light. Alternatively sow the seed in a lightly shaded part of the warm greenhouse in late winter or in a cold greenhouse in April.
R. arboreum readily colonizes newly disturbed ground such as road cuttings and landslides and in the crevices of bare rocks.
  Flowers are sour-sweet and are eaten as pickles, although excess may cause intoxication. A sub-acidic jelly or preserve is made from the petals. The  flower petals are eaten raw as a famine food in India.
The wood is used as fuel and for making charcoal.
Timber:  Sapwood reddish to brownish white; heartwood reddish brown, moderately hard, 640 kg/cu. m. It is easy to work, finishing to a smooth surface. It is used for tool handles, boxes and posts and is suitable for plywood.
Medicine: Leaves are applied to the forehead to relieve headache. Unspecified parts are used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery.
Ornamental:  R. arboreum (Lali Guras in Nepal) is distributed throughout the length of Nepal at a variety of altitudes. It is known for its variably colored blossoms, which come in shades of red, pink and white. The blossoming plants are a spectacular sight, with up to twenty blossoms in a single truss. 
Other services: The foliage adds to the plant’s beauty. The under surface of the thick, stiff, leathery dark green leaves are covered with a thin layer of indumentum ranging in color from silver to fawn to deep cinnamon. Certain areas are known for their "

Two varieties are recognized: R. heudelotii var. heudelotii in Ghana, and R. heudelotii var. africanum in Nigeria and westwards. The generic name is based on the Greek words for tick and tree because the seeds were thought to resemble ticks.
Ecology

R. heudelotii is a tree of the fringing, deciduous and secondary forests common throughout the semi-dry, wooded-savannah zone of the region. From lower Senegal to west Cameroon and Fernando Po, to Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola and Tanzania, where it is found scattered in gaps at forest edges and in secondary scrub and thickets.
Native range
Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia
Tree management

Stand establishment is mainly through direct sowing and planting stock. The species is suited for coppicing and  pollarding.
The seeds are liable to insect attack and therefore ash is added to reduce insect damage before storing in a cool, dry place. There are about 5200 seeds/kg.

From lower Senegal to west Cameroon and Fernando Po, to Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola and Tanzania, where it is found scattered in gaps at forest edges and in secondary scrub and thickets.
R. heudelotii regenerates readily from stumps and comes up freely in old fields. It grows spontaneously from seed and is often preserved in the neighbourhood of forest villages. Soaking seeds in cold water for 24 hours hastens germination.
  The seeds are edible but are not valued as food in all areas where it grows. The kernels can be eaten after boiling in water, or in sauce as in Cote d’Ivoire, or mixed with fish, meat or vegetables. In Gabon kernels are roasted and made into a paste.
Wood of R. heudelotii is not popular as a fuel as it burns very quickly.
Fibre:  R. heudelotii is perhaps suitable for paper pulp.
Timber:  The dull, white wood is fibrous, soft, light and perishable. Used for rough planks, coffins, fishing net floats and rafts for heavy timbers. It is curved into fetish masks, spoons, ladles, plates, platters, bowls, dippers and stools. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the wood is used for making drums, which are said to be very sonorous, and in southern Nigeria, Gabon and Angola, it is carved to make the whole or the resonant parts of musical instruments. In Ghana, it is currently recommended for use in insulation, and the sawdust is suitable for use in sun helmets.
Shade or shelter: R. heudelotii is  a popular shade  and shelter for cacao (Theobroma cacao)  in smallholder cocoa cultivation areas in West and Central Africa.
Tannin or dyestuff:  In Guinea the ash is used in indigo dyeing.
Lipids:  Seed kernel is oil bearing and contains about 47% by weight of oil consisting of the fatty acids eleostearic 44%, oleic16%, and 10% each of palmitic, stearic, linoleic and linolenic. The oil is light, yellow, drying, has a sweet taste, is usable in varnish and soft soaps and has industrial application in waterproofing materials.
Medicine:  In Nigeria, root when ground up and mixed with pepper and salt bark is used for constipation. The Temne of Sierra Leone tie to the body bark that has been beaten and warmed to cure elephantiasis. Pregnant Liberian women take a bark liquor to relieve pains and prevent miscarriage. In Cote d’Ivoire, a root-bark decoction taken by mouth is considered a powerful antidysentery medicine. A bark decoction is taken in Gabon for blennorrhoea and painful menstruation and as a poison antidote.
Ornamental:  R. heudelotii is a popular avenue tree in Uganda.
Soil improver:  The cake from seed-oil extraction is a good nitrogenous fertilizer.
Intercropping:  When not grown in pure stands, it has always been intercropped with coffee, cocoa or bananas."
Robinia pseudoacacia,"Local names:
 Dutch (robinia,valse acacia,schotdoorn), English (acacia locust,black locust,Chinese scholar tree,false acacia,honey locust,robinia,yellow locust,white acacia,white locust,locust tree), French (acacia blanc,robinier faux-acacia,acacia des jardiniers), Hi
Robinia pseudoacacia is a medium-size tree, 25 m tall, 60 cm dbh; trunk irregular; crown open, irregular; branches short, brittle; the persistent stout spines on young shoots are found on mature wood; the smooth bark becomes reddish-brown and deeply furrowed with age.

Leaves are deciduous, alternate, pinnately compound, composed of 7-19 leaflets (terminal leaflets present) on a central stalk 20-30 cm long; 2 spines (modified stipules) at the base of each leaf; leaflets oval, 30-50 mm long, dull green, bristle tipped, smooth margined.

Flowers showy, white, pealike, fragrant, in loose, drooping clusters, about 14 cm long, arising from leaf axils near the tip of a new shoot.

Fruits are pods, 7-10 cm long, flat; husk thin walled, smooth, dark to reddish-brown, several on a central stalk, remain on the tree during winter; seeds dark, beanlike, 3-5 mm long, 5-8 per pod, with a hard impermeable coat.

The genus was named after Jean Robin (1550-1629) and his son Vespasien Robin (1579-1662), herbalists to Henri IV of France, who 1st cultivated R. pseudoacacia in Europe. The specific name is derived from Greek ‘pseudes’ (false), and ‘acacia’; the tree looks like an acacia though it is not one. The name ‘locust’ was given by early missionaries who fancied that the tree was the one that supported St John in the wilderness. It is, however, an American tree, which is not native to any other part of the world.
Ecology

Apart from its cold tolerance, in ecology R. pseudoacacia resembles many other fast-growing, secondary forest legumes. However, it grows well on poor sites as acidic as pH 4.8. Although native to regions of 1000 mm annual rainfall, it survives on as little rain as 400 mm and withstands long dry periods. The trees are pioneers on disturbed soils or burned sites. It dominates early forest regeneration in many native forest stands. The tree does not tolerate waterlogging or shade.
Native range
United States of America
Tree management

Since its Rhizobium is very specific and growth can be completely stunted by the absence of nodulation, a new introduction of R. pseudoacacia must be accompanied by Rhizobia. It coppices readily and may even be lopped annually.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seeds are safely dried to 4% mc, and a few seeds germinate after 50 years of storage at room temperature; viability is maintained for 10 years or more in air-dry storage at 0-5 deg. C; dry seeds survive overnight in liquid nitrogen. There are about 50 000 seeds/kg.

It dominates early forest regeneration in many native forest stands. The tree does not tolerate waterlogging or shade.
Direct seeding and transplanting are the preferred methods for establishment. The seeds need scarification to germinate well (mechanical or immersion in boiling water). Tree suckers readily form roots and graft easily. They can be propagated, though with difficulty, from hardwood cuttings 15-30 cm long and 1-2 cm in diameter. Treatment with Indole Acetic Acid improves rooting. The tree responds well to tissue culture and has been mass propagated by this method. In nursery culture, R. pseudoacacia is either direct seeded or root sections (5-8 cm long) are planted.
Poison:  Early studies revealed toxins called robin and robinit in the bark, leaves and flowers that are believed to be associated with animal poisoning.
Rapid growth, dense wood and nitrogen-fixing ability make it ideal for colonizing degraded sites. The tree is used extensively to rehabilitate surface mine tailings and to stabilize road banks and mine spoils.
The species is lopped heavily for fodder. Mature leaves average 20-25% crude protein, 12% fibre and 45-50% nitrogen-free extracts; variation in these values is high. Tannin levels are high in young leaves but decrease with maturity. Despite the presence of toxins in the leaves, the fodder is considered highly attractive to many animals.
Apiculture:  R. pseudoacacia honey is regarded as one of the world’s finest. The slowly granulating honey is water-white, heavy bodied, fine flavoured with high fructose and low enzyme content. Tree improvement for late flowering and nectar sugar content 
R. pseudoacacia wood burns hot and slowly, like coal, and makes good charcoal. Wood energy yield is typical of temperate broadleaf trees, about 19.44 kJ/kg. Fuelwood plantations in South Korea coppice readily and may even be lopped annually, yielding 10-20 t/ha of fuel. In Hungary, R. pseudoacacia is often grown on small private farms for wood.
Fibre:  R. pseudoacacia is a preferred wood for pulp production.
Timber:  R. pseudoacacia is high in specific gravity (0.8) and variable in colour, but it darkens to an attractive golden brown. The wood’s hardness makes it difficult to work, but it has been widely used for fence posts, household furniture, wooden pins, wagon-wheel hubs, panelling, siding flooring, boat building, decking, vineyard or nursery props, fruit boxes and pallets. High levels of the alkaloid taxifloin make the wood very resistant to rot.
Nitrogen fixing:  This tree could be called ‘the grandfather’ of nitrogen-fixing trees. In the 1890s, R. pseudoacacia was the 1st tree to reveal nodules and symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
Ornamental:  Being a Papilionoideae legume with white butterfly flowers, R. pseudoacacia can serve well as an ornamental tree around homesteads.
A dense growth habit makes R. pseudoacacia suitable for windbreaks. It is grown in the Appalachians particularly for fence posts.
Soil improver:  Nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus are available through leaf litter fall.
Intercropping:  R. pseudoacacia may prove useful for alley cropping in temperate climates. Researchers at the Rodale Research Center in Pennsylvania, USA, are experimenting with intercropping R. pseudoacacia with vegetables. Numerous reports indicate the beneficial effect of this nitrogen-fixing tree to associated plants through improved soil fertility. Mixed plantings of black locust and conifers, however, can lead to reduced growth or death of the slower growing conifers because of shading and overtopping."

Salix babylonica,"Local names:
 Chinese (chui liu), English (weeping willow,babylon weeping willow), French (saule pleureur de chine,saule pleureur,saule parasol,saule de Babylone), German (trauerweide,chinesische haengeweide,ränenweide,hängeweide,gräberweide), Italian (salice piangent
Salix babylonica is a deciduous, short-lived tree to 20 m tall and d.b.h. of 60-80 cm. Stem furrowed, usually dividing near the ground, crown open, branches pendulous. Bark grey-black.

Leaves lanceolate to linear lanceolate, 9-16 cm long, 0.5-1.5 cm wide, margins finely serrate, slightly shiny, dark green above, grey-green with distinctly reticulate venation beneath. Leaf stalk 5-10 mm long, pubescent. 

Flowers in short, terminal catkins on leafy peduncles.  Male catkin is 1.8-3 cm long, 0.5-1 cm wide. Female catkin 1.5-2.5 cm long, 0.5 cm wide, appearing with leaves in April-May. 

Fruit a yellowish-brown capsule, narrowly conic to 3-4 mm long, glabrous.
Ecology

S. babylonica prefers moist environments and commonly occurs along water courses, on damp valley bottoms, and in depressions amidst sand. Weeping willow is a light-demanding species, so it has difficulty regenerating under forest canopies. It can even grow on wetlands. It tolerates flooding, and in extreme cases even submergence. Around lakes and beaches, weeping willow often forms a mixed willow-reed plant community.
Native range
China
Tree management

For pulpwood plantations or other small-stem timber forest stands, planting density ranges from 2200 to 3300 trees/ha, while a density of 1600-2200 trees/ha is used for mine timber production. The rotation of weeping willow varies according to the final product required. Trees aged 2 to 5 years old are harvested for cuttings to make planting stock; 5- and 7-year-old trees are cut for pulpwood. Seedling plantations grow slowly initially, but have a long life span and eventually produce large-sized timber. There is a significant difference in plantation growth between those established from seedlings and those originating from cuttings. The average height of an 8-year-old seedling stand is 8.3 m, but it is 17.8 m for a plantation from cuttings; average stem diameter is 14.3 cm and 42 cm, respectively. 
Weeping willow has a very strong capacity to sprout. Young shoots can reach 3 m high in one growing season. Thus, sprouting stands will gradually form when trees are harvested by clear cutting. After 10 years, average height and stem diameter of shoot sprouts may be approximately 10 m tall and 12.3 cm, respectively.
There are more than 6 million seeds/kg. Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant. The viability of air-dry seed is 5-10 days.

Around lakes and beaches, weeping willow often forms a mixed willow-reed plant community.
S. babylonica is easily propagated by cuttings, and clonal planting stock is the norm in forestry practice. Vegetative propagation has been employed largely because only the male tree is common. One-year-old twigs are cut into 10- to 15-cm segments and struck into a nursery bed filled with good quality loam or sandy-loam soil.  Seed propagation is occasionally employed. Seeds should be sown on moist nursery beds immediately after collection. At 20-25°C, fresh leaves expand and fine rhizoids appear 24 hours after sowing. The height of seedlings can reach 10-15 cm with 3-4 pairs of alternate leaves after one month and 200 cm after one year.
Erosion control:  Planting the tree along riverbanks prevents soil and water erosion, wave-shock and minimizes sediment deposition. In New Zealand, willows are widely grown for soil conservation purposes, where they are the most abundant exortic species after Pinus radiata.
The leaves and tender shoots are used as fodder for cows and goats in some areas. The fodder compares favourably with lucerne. In a survey carried out in Bumthang district, Bhutan, in 1982, Salix babylonica was found to be among the preferred fodder trees by farmers.
Apiculture: The flowers are a good source of honey.
Wood and branches of S. babylonica were traditionally used for fuelwood in China.
Fibre: S. babylonica is a source of pulpwood and produces good quality newsprint paper also used for wrapping papers and high grade Kraft paper. Branches are used for basket making.
Timber:  Weeping willow wood is usually reddish-brown, light and soft, with a straight grain, and of moderate density (325-450 kg/cu. m). It is widely used for furniture, packing cases, agricultural tools, fibreboard, plywood and mine poles
Shade or shelter:  Weeping willow is an important tree species for farmland shelterbelts.
Medicine: Leaves and bark have astringent and tonic properties. Catkins and young twigs antipyretic. A leaf infusion is given to rheumatics.
Ornamental:  S. babylonica is also valuable as an ornamental garden and park tree. The male is mainly the one planted for ornamental purposes.
Pollution control:  It tolerates high levels of sulfur dioxide."

The generic name was given in 1749 in honour of an apothecary of Barcelona, Juan Salvador y Bosca (1598-1681), by Dr Laurent Garcin, botanist, traveller and plant collector. The true specimen of this species came, as the specific name indicates, from Persia.
Ecology

S. persica is widespread, notably in thorn shrubs, desert floodplains, river and stream bank vegetation, and grassy savannahs. Prefers areas where groundwater is readily available, by riverbanks, on perimeters of waterholes, in seasonally wet sites, and along drainage lines in arid zones. Also found in valleys, on dunes and on termite mounds.

The tree is able to tolerate a very dry environment with mean annual rainfall of less than 200 mm. Highly salt tolerant, it can grow on coastal regions and inland saline soils.

Tree management

For high seed settings and seed oil content, harvesting is recommended 3 months after seed setting. This may be due to the utilization of food reserve in the cotyledons for the development of fruit pulp, and can be seen as the pulp content of fruit increases.

Coppicing is advantageous for the tree’s use as a fuel, and the branches are repeatedly cut to produce short stems that are harvested for toothbrushes. S. persica is grown in plantations or hedges. It is generally a slow-growing tree.
Seed storage is orthodox; seeds can be stored with low moisture content. There are about 3400 seeds/kg.

The tree is able to tolerate a very dry environment with mean annual rainfall of less than 200 mm. Highly salt tolerant, it can grow on coastal regions and inland saline soils.
Readily germinates from seed. Seeds exhibit no dormancy but the fruit pulp contains germination inhibitors that should be removed before sowing. The process of seed germination starts with imbibition in water at 30-35 deg. C for 24-72 hours, but under saline conditions the absorption of water is dependent upon osmotic pressure of the media and cell sap. Soaked, depulped seeds of S. persica will germinate in 24 hours. Seeds have been raised in the nursery for up to 3 years prior to transplanting in the field.
Planted in sand dune reclamation and also useful for reclaiming saline soils.
  Fruits have a sweet, agreeable, aromatic, slightly pungent and peppery taste. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or dried and stored. Fruit with or without seeds is said to contain 1.7-1.86% sugars when ripe. Fermented drinks are also made from the fruit. The leaf is somewhat bitter and aromatic, with a taste likened to mustard. The leaves are also cooked as a sauce and eaten with couscous or as a green vegetable. Tender shoots, seeds and seed oil are also edible. Edible salts are obtained from ashes.
Leaves and young shoots are browsed by all stock, but normally cattle do not occur in the driest part of the S. persica distribution range and hence it tends to be valued more as a camel, sheep and goat forage. Leaves make good fodder as their water content is high (15-36%). The high salt content of the leaves is said to affect the taste of milk, but the leaves are said to increase lactation in cows.
Apiculture:  S. persica is reported as a good source of nectar.
The wood is sometimes used for firewood and charcoal. However, it is not used for cooking meat, as it leaves a foul taste.
Timber:  The wood is soft, white, easy to work and is not liable to termite attack. Used for coffins and clubs.
Shade or shelter:  Planted as shelterbelts and windbreaks to protect farm habitation, gardens and orchards.
Lipids:  Seeds of S. persica contain 30-40% of a greenish-yellow, non-edible oil that has over 50% lauric and myristic acids. It has a high melting point and a disagreeable odour that disappears on purification. The most important aspect of the oil is the presence of a low percentage of C8 and C10 fatty acids that are of great economic significance. The oil is an alternative source of oil for soap and detergent industries.
Medicine:  Toothbrushes made from roots and small branches of about 3-5 mm diameter have been used for over 1000 years, especially by Islamic populations in India, Arabia and Africa. Several agents occurring in the bark and wood have been suggested as aids in prevention of dental caries, such as antimicrobial agents that suppress bacterial growth and the formation of plaque. The tooth stick is also said to relieve toothache and gum disease. Roots also are used for cleaning teeth and for relieving toothache. Decoctions of leaves are used as a mouthwash, and masticated leaves for tooth and gum problems. A decoction of the root is used to treat gonorrhoea, spleen trouble and general stomach-ache. Roots are also used for chest diseases or pounded and used as a poultice to heal boils. The bark is scratched and the latex used for treating sores. Seeds are used as a tonic, and seed oil is used on the skin for rheumatism. 
Gum or resin:  Resin that drips from the tree is supposedly useful for making varnish."

Santalum album,"Local names:
 Bengali (chandan,sufaid-chandan,peetchandan,srikhanda), Burmese (santagu), English (sandal,cendana,sandal tree,East Indian sandalwood,white Indian sandalwood,sandalwood), French (Santal blanc), German (Weisser Sandel(holz)ßaum), Gujarati (sukhad,sukhet),
Santalum album is a small evergreen tree that grows to 4 m in Australia, but in India it is much larger and can grow to a height of 20 m; girth of up to 2.4 m, with slender drooping branchlets. Bark is tight, dark brown, reddish, dark grey or nearly black, smooth in young trees, rough with deep vertical cracks in older trees, red inside.

Leaves thin, usually opposite, ovate or ovate elliptical, 3-8 x 3-5 cm, glabrous and shining green above, glaucous and slightly paler beneath; tip rounded or pointed; stalk grooved, 5-15 cm long; venation noticeably reticulate.

Flowers purplish-brown, small, straw coloured, reddish, green or violet, about 4-6 mm long, up to 6 in small terminal or axillary clusters, unscented in axillary or terminal, paniculate cymes.

Fruit a globose, fleshy drupe; red, purple to black when ripe, about 1 cm in diameter, with hard ribbed endocarp and crowned with a scar, almost stalkless, smooth, single seeded.

The generic name is derived from the Greek ‘santalon’ meaning ‘sandalwood’, and the species name from the Latin ‘albus’ meaning ‘white’, in allusion to the bark.
Ecology

S. album is indigenous to the tropical belt of the Indian peninsula, eastern Indonesia and northern Australia. There is still debate as to whether S. album is endemic to Australia or was introduced by fishermen or birds from eastern Indonesia centuries ago. The main distribution is in the drier tropical regions of India and the Indonesian islands of Timor and Sumba. The principal sandal tracts are most parts of Karnataka and adjoining districts of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in India. The species is mostly found in dry deciduous and scrub forests in this region. The vegetation type is a typical monsoon vine thicket growing on pure sand. It has been recorded on coastal sand dunes immediately above the normal high water mark and close to the mangroves. It also grows on low lateritic cliffs above the beach. It is a partial parasite that attaches to the roots of other trees, it needs ‘nurse’ species in the area of planting out. Host plants that fix nitrogen and provide light shade are preferred. Senna siamea is good for this, and a most probable natural host is Drypetes lasiogyna, observed to be the most prolific species in the vicinity of S. album. It does not tolerate frost or waterlogging, but is drought-hardy and is a light demander in sapling and later stages. Prolonged drought and fire kill trees.

Tree management

The yield of the heartwood varies according to age and locality. As a rule of thumb, each tree adds 1 kg of heartwood to its weight each year after the age of 15 years. On deep rich soils in moist areas, trees grow luxuriantly but the heartwood formation is slow and the oil content is low, while the slower-growing trees on difficult sites at elevations between 600-900 m and in rainfall zones of 500-1 000 mm develop maximum heartwood with high oil content. Girth increments for S. album in India are 1-1.3 cm/year in natural stands and up to 5 cm annually in cultivated areas. Between-tree variation in heartwood content and oil yields is high, indicating considerable scope for selection and breeding. Seedlings require protection from wild animals and cattle; nurse bushes provide such protection, and also protect them from excessive heat of the sun, which can kill the tender seedlings in the hot summer months. It is desirable not to clean-weed all round the sandal seedlings, as the roots form haustorial connections with adjoining weed growth. Spacing adopted for raising pure plantations is 3 x 3 - 5 x 5 m. Plantations should strictly be protected from fire. Trees attain exploitable stage (over 15 cm diameter at breast height) in about 30 years, yielding about 50 kg of heartwood, and attain 25 cm dbh in 40 years; such a well-grown tree, including the roots, can yield over 250 kg of scented heartwood. Young sandal trees coppice well. Whole tree harvesting is employed, and both living and dead trees are utilized.
Good seed is reported from trees over 20 years of age. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; no loss in viability after 2 years storage at room temperature (seed longevity declines rapidly at room temperature); viability is reduced from 90-15% after 3 years storage at 7 deg. C with 30-45% r.h. Seeds tolerate desiccation to 2% mc, and no loss in viability is observed after 16 months hermetic storage at 4 deg. C with 3-10% mc. On average there are 4 300-6 800 seeds/kg.

Most natural seedlings of sandal are found growing in the middle of thorny bushes, where the birds have dropped the seeds. Artificial propagation is easily done by directly dibbling freshly collected ripe seeds in worked up soil patches, with the onset of the monsoon, in the middle of the nurse bushes or in protected patches. Fresh seed has a dormancy period of 2 months. Manual scarification or gibberellic acid can break this. They germinate in about 8-14 days, with a germination rate of 70%. Lantana camara, commonly found growing in scrub forests in areas suitable for sandal, acts as a good nurse to the seedlings in the early stages. Planting of container-raised seedlings or branch cuttings is also successful; trees are raised with a host plant, for example Cajanus cajan, Senna siamea, Terminalia, Lagerstroemia, Anogeissus, Dalbergia, Pongamia, Albizia and Acacia species. Seeds can be sown in polythene bags along with the sandal seeds and watering is once a day. Sandal seedlings attain a height of 15-20 cm by planting time and are planted out in the field along with the host plant. Seedling growth is rapid with 20-30 cm obtained at the end of the 1st year and 60-70 cm at the end of the 2nd year. Root suckers are produced when roots are exposed or injured. The nursery phase to raise sturdy 30 cm plants is usually 8 months. Primary host species are grown alongside the seedlings in each pot. S. album has been propagated vegetatively by tissue culture, branch cuttings and cleft grafting. Direct sowing in the fields is used in some situations. Secondary host species should be well established on the planting site before planting. Acacia, Casuarina, Paraserianthes and Sesbania spp are amongst a wide range of successful hosts. Weed control and protection from grazing and fire are essential.
  Fruits are edible.
Trees are sometimes lopped for fodder; the foliage of S. album is palatable to grazing animals such as rabbits, sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, horses and camels.
The wood has been used as a fuel but is generally considered too valuable for this purpose.
Timber:  S. album is mainly grown for its timber, which weighs 870 kg/cubic m, is durable and strong. Its close grained heartwood is used for ornamental and carving work.
Shade or shelter:  Branches grow densely and are capable of intercepting high wind velocity, thus protecting crops.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark contains about 12-14% tannin and has good potential in the tanning industry. Seeds yield an oil that can be used in the manufacture of paint.
Ornamental:  Sandal tree is planted in house gardens as an ornamental.
Trees can be planted along hedges and field boundaries.
Soil improver:  Leaves make good green manure.
Intercropping:  S. album can be profitably raised along with other trees near or on the farm, thereby providing farmers with additional income.
Essential oil:  A valuable oil, ‘the sandal oil’, is distilled from the heartwood (yield varies from 4-10%) and is used in perfumery, soap making and medicines. The roots contain maximum quantity of oil and hence are more valuable."
Santalum ellipticum,"Local names:
 English (sandalwood tree,sandalwood,coastal sandalwood), French (bois de santal), Hawaian (iliahialo‘e), Spanish (sándalo)
Santalum ellipticum is a sprawling shrub to small tree, 1–5 m tall and 1–3 m in canopy diameter, maximally reaching 12 m tall and 5 m in canopy diameter, and bole diameter at breast height (dbh) of 30 cm.  The species forms an extensive network of surface roots capable of grafting onto roots of other species that serve as a source of water and mineral nutrients.

Leaves elliptic to orbicular, ovate, or obovate and leathery to succulent; 2.5–6.1 cm long and 1.7–4 cm wide, with petioles up to 15 mm long; dull, grayish green, with glaucous upper and lower surfaces.

Inflorescence greenish tinged with brown, or orange, produced in terminal compound cymes. Pedicels 0–1 mm long, the floral tube campanulate to conical, 4–7 mm long, with an inferior ovary. Flowers produce a sweet fragrance. 

Fruits purple to black drupes, often glaucous, 9–12 mm long, with a distinctive apical receptacular ring.  The kernels consist of a hard, woody, smooth or slightly rough, lightcolored endocarp enclosing a single seed.
Ecology

Santalum ellipticum grows near the ocean shore, in dry gulches, on slopes or ridges, and frequently in rocky habitats. The species also grows in arid shrub land and forest, often persisting in areas invaded by nonnative species.  Associated species include 
Wikstroemia sandwicensis and the Nihoa Island fan palm Pritchardia remota in windward, lowland areas. In more dry environments S. ellipticum is associated with Chenopodium oahuense and Chamaesyce hypericifolia.

Coastal sandalwood can survive with up to 60–70% shade, with growth rates slower at higher shade levels. The optimum level of shade is up to about 25%, preferably as side shade. 

Sandalwood species generally have a capacity for invasiveness in disturbed, more open plant communities.  This is not considered a problem because of their very high value, their small stature, and the fact that they do not appear to modify such communities in any substantial way.  Being parasitic, importation of viable Santalum seed into the U.S. (including Hawai‘i) is prohibited by federal law.

Tree management

Seedlings are ready for out planting after about 6 months when height is about 20–25 cm.
Planting should be among established long term host plants or together with intermediate hosts while longer term hosts are established. For high survival rates planting should be at the onset of the rainy season and be kept well weeded in the first 2 years. 

Spacing for commercial production should vary depending on type of planting. The final crop should be around 100 mature trees per hectare due to the need to include host tree/shrub species (at a rate of 2–4 per sandalwood trees depending on host species).  

In shady situations, plants exhibit reasonably strong self pruning characteristics. Suitable shade regimes to keep plants growing straight and to avoid a bushy habit should be provided by either a strong lateral shade with no overhead shade or a high canopy of intermediate shade.  

Surrounding host species may require pruning, especially if they grow much faster than sandalwood in order to allow adequate light to penetrate.

For low fertility soils, fertilizing with a handful (up to 100 g) of slow release
NPK fertilizer per tree may help when trees show signs of yellowing or slow growth.
Seeds should be collected while still attached to the tree or from the ground, often with the pulp decayed or removed by birds.

The fleshy mesocarp should be removed from the fruits immediately. Hard fruit should be soaked for 1- 2 days to soften the pulp prior to its removal. The de-pulped, cleaned seeds should then be disinfected, rinsed and air dried at a temperature below 25°C, for up to 2 - 3 weeks. Seeds exhibit intermediate storage behavior, with seed rapidly losing viability during storage. If seeds must be stored, they should be placed in airtight containers in the refrigerator (2 - 4°C) as soon as possible following surface drying. Generally, ultra dry storage (e.g., down to about 2% moisture) is recommended for this type of seed.

Sandalwood seeds should be sown as soon as possible after collection to reduce the risk of losing viability during storage. Germination of up to 90% can be achieved with fresh and healthy seed and proper germination technique.  Scarification process involving the removal of a small part of the seed coat at the apex of the seed should be done to expose the embryo but not damage it; using nail clippers, forceps, or medium sandpaper. Soaking the seeds in a growth hormone solution like diluted (0.05%) gibberellic acid for 5 days, changing the solution daily is recommended. Seeds should then be dusted with a 1:1 mixture of powdered sulfur and captan to prevent fungus infection.

The optimum temperature for germination should be between 28°C and 31°C. Seeds should begin to germinate after approximately a week and continue germinating over a 2 - 3 week period with a success rate of over 90% even for seeds more than 6 months old.

Propagation is readily by seed; wildings can also be collected from underneath selected heavy fruit bearing specimens and then transplanted.  Other methods include cuttings (preferably from young plants) and grafting.
Erosion control:  S. ellipticum provides a small amount of coastal protection, as it can grow within a few meters of the sea.
  The seed kernels are edible (and some say tasty), although the scarcity of seeds and their high value for propagation makes their use as food somewhat inappropriate.
Apiculture:  When in flower, the trees are visited by honeybees.
In Hawai‘i, Santalum spp. were sometimes used for firewood.
Timber:  Sandalwood is used for carving religious statues and objects, handicrafts, art, and decorative furniture, musical instruments and canoe construction.  
Medicine:  A shampoo made from a leaf infusion was used for curing dandruff and eliminating head lice. A drink made from finely ground powdered heartwood, mixed with other plants, followed by laxative was used in curing diseases of both male and female sex organs
Ornamental:  The species is quite attractive, especially when in flower, and suitable for home gardens and urban environments, in a mixture of host species, and high protection.  Perhaps the greatest value of growing sandalwood in the landscape is the satisfaction of nurturing this esteemed cultural tree.  The flowers and berries are attractive, and the flowers are mildly scented. 
Boundary or barrier:  Sandalwoods are suitable for inclusion in windbreaks, especially where the main windbreak species include good hosts, e.g., Casuarina spp
Intercropping:  Sandalwoods are suitable for inclusion in alley cropping systems, especially where the other alley species include good hosts, e.g., Calliandra spp.  it is also suitable for inclusion in woodlots, especially when planted along sun exposed edges and in combination with compatible species, e.g Acacia koa.
Essential oils:  Heartwood from sandalwood trees yields an aromatic oil which is widely valued and has been the basis of a lucrative and exploitative trade for hundreds of years. The oil is used in cosmetics, for scenting of soaps, perfumery, aromatherapy"

Schima wallichii,"Local names:
 Bengali (cheloni,mukria sal,makrisal), Burmese (laukya), Chinese (he,muhe,heshu,hemu,haozi
haozi,gaobei,Chinese guger tree), English (needlewood,schima), Hindi (makusal,kanak,dieng-shyr-nagan,chilauni,nogabhe), Indonesian (seru,madang gatal,puspa), Java
Schima wallichii is an evergreen, medium-sized to large tree growing to 47 m in height; bole cylindrical, branchless for up to 25 m, diameter up to 125 (max. 250) cm, with a steep buttresses rarely up to 1.8 m high; bark surface ruggedly cracked into small, thick, angular pieces, red-brown to dark grey; inner bark with skin-irritating fibres, bright red in colour.

Leaves spiral, oblong to broadly elliptic, 6-13 x 3-5 cm; base wedge shaped; apex acute to acuminate; margin toothed; secondary veins 6-8 pairs; petioles about 3 mm long. 

Flowers solitary in axils at the apices of twigs, with 2 bracteoles, pentamerous; sepals subequal, persistent in fruit; petals connate at base, white, with a rosy flush; stamens many, adnate to the corolla base; anthers versatile; ovary superior, 5-locular with 2-6 ovules in each cell; style simple.

Fruit a woody subglobose capsule, 2-3 cm in diameter, silky, opening by 5 valves; seeds winged all around.

The genus name is derived from the Greek word skiasma-‘shadow’, probably referring to the dense crown.
Ecology

S. wallichii is a common tree that can grow in a wide range of climates, habitats and soils. Its light requirements are moderate.  It often occurs gregariously in primary lowland to montane forest, but is particularly common in disturbed and secondary forests, scrub and grassland and even in areas inundated with brackish water.
Native range
Brunei, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Survival of planted out seedlings is almost 100%. In peninsular Malaysia, they are planted out at a spacing of 1.8 x 1.2 m or 3.6 x 1.8 m; resulting in almost double diameter increments for the wider spacing. Early growth is comparatively slow, accelerating later. S. wallichii coppices easily; it is fairly resistant to fire from the age of 5 years, when it can reproduce by coppice shoots.
Seed storage behaviour is recalcitrant; seeds cannot be stored and are short-lived in open storage at room temperature. Dried fruits or seeds can be stored for up to 3 months, although 1 record in Nepal shows that they can be stored for a long time without problems. There are 196 000-267 000 dry seeds/kg.
S. wallichii is a common tree that can grow in a wide range of climates, habitats and soils. Its light requirements are moderate.  It often occurs gregariously in primary lowland to montane forest, but is particularly common in disturbed and secondary forests, scrub and grassland and even in areas inundated with brackish water.
S. wallichii can be raised from seed; the use of cuttings has not been successful. Wildings have been collected from natural regeneration in plantations. The woody capsules should be collected before dehiscing, and seeds can be extracted after capsules dry and open. It has been stated that the seed needs ‘after-ripening’ of about 2 weeks following storage. Germination rates vary considerably: seeds of S. wallichii give about 90% germination in 10-12 days, but in some seedlots have presented germination inrates of only 15% in 23-85 days. In general, germination 25-rates attained are about 25-55%. Seedlings have epigeal germination. 

Seeds are sown under shade and only lightly covered with soil. Seedling mortality in the nursery is usually about 50%. After 2-3 months seedlings are 5-8 cm tall and can be transplanted from the seedbed to containers; at 6-8 months, when they are about 20 cm tall, they can be planted out in the field, although stumps may be made of older seedlings.
Poison:  The bark contains an alkaloid used as a fish poison.
S. wallichii is useful for reforestation and in water conservation in catchment areas.
Erosion control: In the northeastern regions of India, planting cardamon and S. wallichii are some of the ideal agroforestry systems for conserving soil and water.
In Nepal, the leaves are used for fodder.
S. wallichii produces good firewood. The energy value of the sapwood is about 19 980 kJ/kg.
Fibre:  Wood is suitable for paper pulp.
Timber:  S. wallichii yields a medium-weight to heavy hardwood with a density of 450-920 kg/cubic cm at 15% mc. Heartwood is pink-brown, red-brown or grey-brown, but is sometimes dark red-brown; it is not clearly differentiated from the pale grey sapwood; grain is straight or interlocked, frequently irregular; texture moderately fine or fine and even. Shrinkage is moderate to very high, and the timber seasons fairly rapidly; in Malaysia, boards 13 mm and 38 mm thick were observed to take about 2.5 months and 3 months, respectively, to air-dry. The wood is moderately durable and hard and is fairly strong. It is easy to work with hand and machine tools and polishes satisfactorily. Wood is relatively resistant to dry-wood termites. Used for medium-heavy construction that is under cover, such as columns and beams, for flooring, interior fitting, panelling, door and window frames, joinery, utility furniture, ship and boat building (ribs, decks), vehicle bodies, agricultural implements, pallets, boxes and crates, poles, toys, turnery and, when treated, for railway sleepers. It has been used for bridge building in mountain areas, and young trees have been used as rafters. Good-quality plywood can be manufactured from the wood, and it is suitable for the production of wood-wool boards.
Shade or shelter:  In India, S. wallichii has been used as a shade tree in coffee plantations.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Bark is used for dyeing and its tannin is used in processing skins. Leaves also contain tannin but not in quantity enough for economic use in tanning.
Lipids:  Seed of S. wallichii from India contains 19% oil.
Medicine:  The astringent corollas are used to treat uterine disorders and hysteria. The crude drug is called ‘buah cangkok’ in Indonesia, and ‘changkoh’ in peninsular Malaysia.
Intercropping:  In Indonesia, S. wallichii has been used a cover crop in plantations of Pinus merkusii and Agathis dammara"
Schinus molle,"Local names:
 Amharic (qundo berbere), Arabic (felfel-kazib,filfilrafie), English (pepper tree,California pepper tree,Chilean pepper tree,mastic tree,molle,pepper berry tree,weeping pepper,Peruvian mastic,pink pepper,Peruvian pepper tree), French (faux Poivrier du Per
Schinus molle is an evergreen tree with weeping foliage, 3-15 m in height; trunk short; crown with equal spread; bark dark brown, deeply fissured, flaking; very sticky latex forms if the bark is damaged.

Leaves imparipinnate, with a winged rachis and 20-40 leaflets; leaflets linear-lanceolate, margins entire or dentate, 2-5 cm x 4-8 mm.

Flowers in hanging panicles can grow to 30 cm long; petals about 2 mm long; drooping clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers develop into bunches of pink berries; the more female flowers a tree has the more berries will develop; some trees have mostly male flowers and have almost no ‘peppers’. 

Fruits are small, round berries that develop from green to red then black.

The similarity of this species to the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus) is revealed in the origin of its generic name, from the Greek name for the mastic tree, ‘shinos’. The specific name ‘molle’ is the name by which the tree is known in western South America and is derived from ‘mulli’, the old Peruvian name. The common name ‘pepper-tree’ is due to the fact that the fruits contain seeds with a sharp taste, used for flavouring as a pepper substitute.
Ecology

S. molle tolerates high temperatures and once established is extremely drought resistant; resistant to frost and temperatures as low as -10 deg. C. It is shallow rooted and can be brittle; therefore, it is likely to be blown over or have its branches broken off in strong wind. A fire-retardant plant species.
Native range
Argentina, Bolivia, Peru
Tree management

Reaches maturity in less than 20 years. Has a low-branching habit, and pruning of lower branches is recommended when the tree is young if clearance beneath is desired and to reduce the chances of the tree being blown over. Coppicing, pollarding and lopping also are viable methods of managing the tree. Planting the trees away from buildings will avoid possible damage from the fall of heavy branches as trees age.
Orthodox storage behaviour; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 10 deg. C with 9-12% mc. There are 31 000-44 000 seeds/kg.

It is shallow rooted and can be brittle; therefore, it is likely to be blown over or have its branches broken off in strong wind. A fire-retardant plant species.
Under ideal conditions the seeds germinate in 10-30 days, with a germination rate of 40-80%. No presowing treatment is needed. Sun-dried fruits are pounded using a pestle and mortar then winnowed to separate the seeds from the fruit pulp.
Poison:  The hanging strings of little pink berries of this attractive ornamental tree are reputed to be moderately poisonous, particularly the seed. Leaves are an insect repellant. The pollen, on contact or when inhaled, can cause dermatitis and asthmatic reactions. The tree also has antimicrobial, antifungal, piscicidal and viricidal properties. 
Erosion control:  The tree is planted for soil conservation.
  While not considered poisonous, the berries are not normally eaten. In Mexico, the fruit is ground and mixed with other substances to form beverages. The seeds are sometimes used to adulterate pepper.
Apiculture:  S. molle is suitable for bee forage.
The wood of S. molle can be burned as both firewood and charcoal.
Timber:  Heartwood is a dull, light red, deepening upon exposure and becoming more or less purplish and rather oily looking; distinct but not sharply demarcated from the brownish-grey sapwood; moderately hard and heavy, specific gravity (air-dry) 0.54-0.68; texture medium to fine, uniform; grain variable, often irregular; very easy to work; durability high; wood is termite resistant and therefore suitable for posts.
Shade or shelter:  The wide, multibranched crown provides good shade and acts as a suitable windbreak.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Bark is used for tanning skins. 
Medicine:  Leaf juice is used to treat ophthalmia and rheumatism; a bark extract infusion is used for diarrhoea, and resin of the bark is a dangerous purgative. Other known medicinal properties of the tree include using it as an astringent, a balsamic, diuretic, expectorant, masticatory, stomachic, tonic and vulnerary. The ailments it is known to treat include amenorrhoea, bronchitis, gingivitis, gonorrhoea, gout, tuberculosis, tumour, ulcer, urethritis, wart, wounds, and urogenital and venereal diseases.
Gum or resin:  The tree produces an aromatic resin used as a mastic.
Ornamental:  S. molle is commonly planted as an ornamental; it offers lacy, delicate evergreen foliage, a sculptural, twisted branch structure and an attractive textured bark. Ripe berries are often cut and used fresh or dried in floral displays. The tree has been grown as an indoor bonsai.
It is sometimes planted as a live fence.
Latex or rubber:  Latex is produced from many parts of the tree. 
Alcohol:  An intoxicating liquor known as ‘copalocle’ or ‘copalote’ is obtained by fermenting the fruit with pulque for 1-2 days. 
Essential oil:  The fruit contains a volatile oil and has a flavour resembling that of a mixture of fennel and pepper. The oil of S. molle exhibits significant activity against several bacterial species, such as Alcaligenes faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae"
Schinus terebinthifolius,"Local names:
 English (Florida holly,christmasberry tree,broadleaf pepper tree,Brazilian pepper tree,Bahamian holly), French (poivrier du Bresil,faux poivrier), German (Brasilianischer Pfefferbaum), Spanish (pimienta de Brasil,copal)
S. terebinthifolius is a small tree, 3-10 m tall (ocassionally up to 15 m) and 10-30 cm diameter (occasionally up to 60 cm). S. terebinthifolius may be multi-stemmed with arching, not drooping branches.

Leaves pinnate, up to 40 cm long, with 2-8 pairs of elliptic to lanceolate leaflets and an additional leaflet at the end. Leaflets glabrous, 1.5-7.5 cm long and 7-32 mm wide, the terminal leaflet larger than lateral ones. Leaf margins entire to serrated and glabrous.

Flowers white, in large, terminal panicles. Petals oblong to ovate, 1.2-2.5 mm long. 

Fruits globose, bright red drupes, 4-5 mm in diameter.

This is a highly invasive species that has proved to be a serious weed in South Africa, Florida and Hawaii. It is also noted as invasive in other Caribbean and Indian Ocean islands.  Rapid growth rate, wide environmental tolerance, prolific seed production, a high germination rate, seedling tolerance of shade, attraction of biotic dispersal agents, possible allelopathy and the ability to form dense thickets all contribute to this species' success in its exotic range.
Ecology

Brazilian pepper tree is particularly found on forest borders and river margins. It is associated with damp soils and riparian forest habitats, although it may also appear as a dry savannah plant.
Native range
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay
Tree management

Since Brazilian pepper tree can be invasive if not properly managed, application of appropriate mechanical, chemical and biological measures should be employed to check its wanton spread.

Schinziophyton rautanenii,"Local names:
 Bemba (mukusu), English (wild akkerneut,manketti tree,featherweight tree), Trade name (mugongo), Tswana (mongongo)
Schinziophyton rautanenii is a deciduous tree 8-20(-24) m tall with a closed, spreading crown; trunk to 1 m in diameter, 3-4 clustered, or single bole; bark smooth and flaking.

Leaves alternate, digitately compound, consisting of 5-7 leathery segments usually hairless below and with grey wooly hairs above. There are usually 1 or 2 black glands on the upper side of each leaf-stalk.

Flowers whitish or yellow, dioecious, in loose rusty sprays. Male flowers in long rusty sprays, female shorter in length.

Fruit ovoid, waxy and brown in colour; weighing 7-10 g with a thick leathery skin, fleshy, dry, spongy pulp 2-5 mm thick, shell tough 3-7 mm thick. 

Seeds 1 or 2 in the fruit.
Ecology

S. rautanenii occurs naturally in the southern and western parts of Zambia, its distribution heartland. It is most frequent, occasionally dominant in Kalahari sand woodlands but is also found in munga woodland, scrub mopane and Lake basin chipya. In core distribution areas it occurs in large groves of open woodland as a dominant or co-dominant tree species with Afzelia quanzensis, Baikiaea plurijuga, Brachystegia, Burkea africana, Combretum, Copaifera, Guibourtia coleosperma, Ostyroderris, Pseudolachnostylis, Pterocarpus angolensis, Sclerocarya, Spirostachys and Strychnos cocculoides. The largest groves can be 450 ha and occur on sand dune crests, smaller ones are found where sand banks against bedrock. Also common on hummocks along alluvial margins of important water courses e.g. Zambesi-Mashi.
Native range
Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Once established, the tree requires very little attention. S. rautanenii can withstand years of drought and has few pest and disease incidences. Seed should be sown in sandy soil.
Seeds remain viable for up to 2 years when stored at 10 deg C. Pretreatment for seed involves removal of seeds from the woody endocarp followed by soaking in 1% ethrel for 24 hrs, however the ethrel treatment seems insignificant (Chimbelu, 1983).

Mainly propagated by seed.
Wax:  The highly unsaturated oil may serve well as paint medium and for varnishing purposes.
Poison:  Toxicological results suggest a tenous link between oil use and goitre.
Has potential use in desert encroachment prevention and sand dune stabilization. Its hardiness makes it ideal for arid land reclamation.
Erosion control:  S. rautanenii roots protect sandy soils from wind and water erosion.
  The fruit is edible and can be eaten fresh, dried or cooked and have a pleasant taste likened to that of plums. The fruit retains its flavour even when dry. The fruit is normally skinned after steaming in a pot with little water, then boiled in fresh water to separate the nuts. The fruit is used in making aromatic soups and sweet porridge, they can be dried and consumed as sweetmeats. During roasting direct contact of seeds with the fire coals is avoided by roasting in a sand heap. Fruit carbohydrate content is between 65-77%, fibre 2.5-3%, crude protein 6-9% and Ca levels are 85-100 mg/ 100 g. In the abscence of moisture fruits can remain edible for up to 8 months if left on ground where they fall.
Fruit enjoyed by both cattle and game. Fruit pulp and the seed meal which is very rich in protein was fed to cattle up to 1962, however this feed is suspected to cause a discolouration of beef. Elephants feed on the bark.
Not an important firewood provider.
Fibre:  The inner bark is used in making string for nets.
Timber:  The whitish wood is soft, very light but not very durable, and although wooly it is easy to work and is strong. It was at one time used to make particle board on a commercial scale, and a reasonable paper has been made from it on experimental scale and has potential use in making packing cases and matches. Current uses are the making of masks, drums and temporary canoes.
Shade or shelter:  Offers shade in hot areas e.g. in the Kalahari desert.
Lipids:  The kernel is rich in oil, up to 60% and is suitable for exploitation as an edible oil, this oil is high in linoleic, elaeostearic acid and gamma-tocopherol. The oil’s perishability seems a hindering attribute in its commercial usage. Margarine has been made from the oil in Germany and England.
Medicine:  The roots are used as a remedy for stomach pains, the nuts tied around the ankles are said to relieve leg pains.
Truncheon-cuttings used for fencing around homes in southern Angola.  In some places the tree is highly held culturally and venerable.
Alcohol:  The fruit pulp is fermented to give a refreshing potent beer, distilled for alcohol."
Schizolobium parahybum,"Local names:
 English (the sky’s the limit,reach for the sky,false tree-fern,Brazilian fern tree), Portuguese (guapuruvu,guapiruvu), Spanish (guanacaxtle), Trade name (serebo)
Schizolobium parahybum is unarmed, with a cylindrical bole, high buttresses and a wide spreading, open crown.

Leaves bipinnate, large; pinnae 15-20 pairs, fernlike; leaflets small, elliptic, 10-20 pairs, stipules absent.

Flowers golden yellow, large, profusely produced in axillary semi-erect racemes or terminal panicles; bracts minute; bracteoles absent; calyx tube obliquely turbinate; lobes 5, overlapping, reflexed at flowering; petals 5, clawed, subequal, overlapping, uppermost petal innermost; stamens 10, free, subdeclinate; filaments villous, basally rough; anthers uniform, longitudinally dehiscent; ovary subsessile affixed to 1 side of calyx tube, many-ovuled, style filiform; stigma minute, terminal.

Pod flat, spoon or tear-drop shaped, exocarp firm, leathery, tardily dehiscent.

Seed large, oblong, compressed, located near apex.

The genus Schizolobium has 4-5 members. The generic name is derived from the Greek verb schizo, “divide” and lobion, “pod”; the inner and outer layers of the pod separate at maturity, whereas the specific epithet is after the Parahyba River in Brazil.
Ecology

S. parahybum is a widespread pioneer species from tropical and premontane forests zones of the American Atlantic coast, flourishing on well-drained moist soils on plains or hillsides.
Native range
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico
Tree management

Guapuruvu is fast growing, three year old plants are often 7-8 m tall; forest specimens reach heights of 30-35 m. Water-stress relating to altered watering regimes seems to little affect growth, or readiness for transplantation in nursery seedlings. In one study nursery seedlings watered at intervals (up to 8 days) were ready for transplanting sooner.
Seeds usually need mechanical scarification or thermal shock to ensure germination within 5-15 days. The hard, impermeable seed coat promotes dormancy. Breaking of dormancy is by removal of the seed tip, immersion in boiling water, mechanical scarification, chemical (acid, organic solvent), scarification or brief exposure to fire. Immersion in boiling water is the most effective treatment, in terms of both speed of germination and percentage germination, economy and practicality; after 28 days 92% germination was observed in water immersed seeds. There are 500 seeds/kg.
S. parahybum is a widespread pioneer species from tropical and premontane forests zones of the American Atlantic coast, flourishing on well-drained moist soils on plains or hillsides.
The plant can be easily propagated from seed. Propagation by cuttings is moderately easy and requires treatment with Naphtyl-Acetic Acid.
Erosion control:  The tree protects surrounding soil from soil erosion.
  A number of amino acids are found in the seeds, however, a seed chymotrypsin inhibitor is also reported.
The tree can provide fuelwood.
Timber:  Wood with a low specific gravity of 0.28-0.35 g/cu cm The timber is rarely utilized, possibly because of its repulsive smell when fresh. Wood not durable and resistant to insect attack. Quamwood is a potential source of paper pulp and plywood.
Shade or shelter:  Guapuruvu is an important shade tree.
Nitrogen fixing:  No reports of nodulation are given for guapuruvu.
Ornamental:  A spectacular fast-growing tree popularly cultivated as an ornamental, especially beautiful in flower with masses of yellow gold blossoms.
Soil improver:  The enormous amount of biomass shed by the tree improves soil fertility.
Intercropping:  The Brazilian fern tree is a promising agroforestry species, intercropping is possible because of its light shade."

Timber very hard, heavy, strong and very durable; used for sleepers, house posts, bridge building. The wood is reputed to be highly resistant to decay."
Tamarindus indica,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (tamarinde), Amharic (humer,roka), Arabic (ardeib,aradeib), Bemba (mushishi), Bengali (anbli,amli,nuli,tintul,tintiri,tentul), Burmese (magyee,majee-pen), Creole (tamarenn), English (madeira mahogany,Indian date,tamarind tree), Filipino (sampal
Tamarindus indica is a large evergreen tree up to 30 m tall, bole usually 1-2 m, up to 2 m diameter; crown dense, widely spreading, rounded; bark rough, fissured, greyish-brown. 

Leaves alternate, compound, with 10-18 pairs of opposite leaflets; leaflets narrowly oblong, 12-32 x 3-11 mm, petiole and rachis finely haired, midrib and net veining more or less conspicuous on both surfaces; apex rounded to almost square, slightly notched; base rounded, asymmetric, with a tuft of yellow hairs; margin entire, fringed with fine hairs. Stipules present, falling very early. 

Flowers attractive pale yellow or pinkish, in small, lax spikes about 2.5 cm in width. Flower buds completely enclosed by 2 bracteoles, which fall very early; sepals 4, petals 5, the upper 3 well developed, the lower 2 minute.

Fruit a pod, indehiscent, subcylindrical, 10-18 x 4 cm, straight or curved, velvety, rusty-brown; the shell of the pod is brittle and the seeds are embedded in a sticky edible pulp. Seeds 3-10, approximately 1.6 cm long, irregularly shaped, testa hard, shiny and smooth. 

As the dark brown pulp made from the fruit resembles dried dates, the Arabs called it ‘tamar-u’l-Hind’, meaning ‘date of India’, and this inspired Linnaeus when he named the tree in the 18th century. Tamarindus is a monospecific genus.
Ecology

T. indica grows well over a wide range of soil and climatic conditions, occurring in low-altitude woodland, savannah and bush, often associated with termite mounds. It prefers semi-arid areas and wooded grassland, and can also be found growing along stream and riverbanks. It does not penetrate into the rainforest. Its extensive root system contributes to its resistance to drought and wind. It also tolerates fog and saline air in coastal districts, and even monsoon climates, where it has proved its value for plantations. Young trees are killed by the slightest frost, but older trees seem more cold resistant than mango, avocado or lime. A long, well-marked dry season is necessary for fruiting.
Native range
Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Growth is generally slow; seedling height increasing by about 60 cm annually. The juvenile phase lasts up to 4-5 years, or longer. Young trees are pruned to allow 3-5 well-spaced branches to develop into the main scaffold structure of the tree. After this, only maintenance pruning is required to remove dead or damaged wood. Trees generally require minimal care, but in orchards in Thailand’s central delta, intensive cropping is practised. This is possible because grafted trees come to bear within 3-4 years. Sweet cultivars are planted and good early crops limit extensive growth; presumably the high water table, which prevents deep rooting, also helps to dwarf the trees. Size-control measures include close spacing (about 500 trees/ha) and pruning to rejuvenate the fruiting wood. The trees also respond to coppicing and pollarding. 
When establishing a pure plantation, spacing should be at least 13 x 13 m. Distance can be reduced with vegetatively propagated plants, as they do not attain the same size as seeded trees. Smaller trees are easier to harvest. The tree may remain productive until it reaches old age, yielding up to 150 kg/tree or over 2 t/ha a year.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; no loss in viability during 1 years of hermetic storage at 4 deg. C; and viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 10 deg. C with 7-15% mc. There are approximately 350-1 000 seeds/kg.

Tamarind may be propagated by seeds and by marcotting, grafting and budding, and stem- and air-layering. Pretreatment involves soaking seeds in cold water for 12 hours or nicking the seed; germination is epigeous, and has a rate of about 90% in 40-50 days. Germination is best when seeds are covered by 1.5 cm loose, sandy loam or by a mixture of loam and sand. Seedlings should attain at least 80 cm before being transplanted to their final location at the beginning of the rainy season. 

Outstanding mother trees are propagated asexually. Shield and patch budding and cleft grafting are fast and reliable methods, currently used in large-scale propagation in the Philippines. The best time is during the cool and dry months of November to January. Budded and grafted trees are planted out to the field at the onset of the rainy season (May to June in the Philippines) at a spacing of 8-10 m.
  The fruit pulp, mixed with a little salt, is a favourite ingredient of the curries and chutneys popular throughout India, though most of the tamarind imported into Europe today comes from the West Indies, where sugar is added as a preservative. When freshly prepared, the pulp is a light brown colour but darkens with time; it consists of 8-14% tartaric acid and potassium bitartrate, and 30-40% sugar. Acidity is caused by the tartaric acid, which on ripening does not disappear, but is matched more or less by increasing sugar levels. Hence tamarind is said to be simultaneously the most acid and the sweetest fruit. The ripe fruit of the sweet type is usually eaten fresh, whereas the fruits of sour types are made into juice, jam, syrup and candy. Fruit is marketed worldwide in sauces, syrups and processed foods. The juice is an ingredient of Worcestershire Sauce and has a high content of vitamin B (thiamine and niacin) as well as a small amount of carotene and vitamin C. The flowers, leaves and seeds can be eaten and are prepared in a variety of dishes. Tamarind seeds are also edible after soaking in water and boiling to remove the seed coat. Flour from the seed may be made into cake and bread. Roasted seeds are claimed to be superior to groundnuts in flavour.
The foliage has a high forage value, though rarely lopped for this purpose because it affects fruit yields. In the southern states of India cooked seeds of Tamarind tree are fed to draught animals regularly.
Apiculture:  Flowers are reportedly a good source for honey production.The second grade honey is dark-coloured.
Provides good firewood with calorific value of 4 850 kcal/kg, it also produces an excellent charcoal.
Timber:  Sapwood is light yellow, heartwood is dark purplish brown; very hard, durable and strong (specific gravity 0.8-0.9g/cubic m), and takes a fine polish. It is used for general carpentry, sugar mills, wheels, hubs, wooden utensils, agricultural tools, mortars, boat planks, toys, panels and furniture. In North America, tamarind wood has been traded under the name of ‘madeira mahogany’. 
Shade or shelter:  The extended crown of the tamarind offers shade so that it is used as a ‘rest and consultation tree’ in villages. Because of its resistance to storms it can also be used as a windbreak. It should be considered, however, that T. indica i
Tannin or dyestuff:  Both leaves and bark are rich in tannin. The bark tannins can be used in ink or for fixing dyes. Leaves yield a red dye, which is used to give a yellow tint to clothe previously dyed with indigo. Ashes from the wood are used in removing hair from animal hides. 
Lipids:  An amber coloured seed oil - which resembles linseed oil - is suitable for making paints and varnishes and for burning in lamps. 
Medicine: The bark is astringent and tonic and its ash may be given internally as a digestive. Incorporated into lotions or poultices, the bark may be used to relives sores, ulcers, boils and rashes. It may also be administered as a decoction against asthma and amenorrhea and as a febrifuge. Leaf extracts exhibit anti-oxidant activity in the liver, and are a common ingredient in cardiac and blood sugar reducing medicines. Young leaves may be used in fomentation for rheumatism, applied to sores and wounds, or administered as a poultice for inflammation of joints to reduce swelling and relieve pain. A sweetened decoction of the leaves is good against throat infection, cough, fever, and even intestinal worms. Filtered hot juice of young leaves and a poultice of the flowers are used for conjunctivitis. The pulp may be used as a massage is used to treat rheumatism, as an acid refrigerant, a mild laxative and also to treat scurvy. Powdered seeds may be given to cure dysentery and diarrhoea. 
Ornamental:  The evergreen habit and the beautiful flowers make it suitable for ornamental planting in parks, along roads and riverbanks.
T. indica could be inserted into a live fence."

Tree management

Weeding is necessary to facilitate proper growth at the early stages of establishment but eventually its litter suppresses the weeds. Young seedlings should be protected from grazing. Drastic thinning is done when the plants have attained over two years of growth to (30) 37-50 plants/ha. Pruning is necessary to prevent development into a shrub with many weak main stems which are subject to splitting and breaking off at ground level. Wood can be exploited for fuel in the fourth year after planting. Coppices readily and shoots after heavy lopping which is rare in arid zone species. The species has extensive surface roots which makes it unpopular for intercropping due to excessive competition for water and nutrients with crops. Also older trees have a tendency of blowing over in high wind.
The viability of the recalcitrant seed in open storage is very low, perhaps not more than 1 week, each day of storage diminishes the germinative capacity and therefore success could only be achieved with the immediate sowing. Based on seed size and ecology, the species may show orthodox seed storage behavior. There are 100 000-286 000 seeds/kg.
Popular habitats include sand dunes, canals, riverbanks, wadi beds, salty deserts, salt marshes and coastal plains. The tree is drought, heat, salt and frost tolerant.
Closed capsules do not contain any fertile seed, therefore, only capsules which are just opening or have partly opened should be collected. Not usually propagated from seeds as they loose viability rapidly. Therefore establishment through seed is limited in isolated instances. Easily propagated from cuttings. Cuttings of 10 cm length, stripped of foliage, stored in moist sand for 10 days to develop root buds are planted in the nursery with 1.5 cm exposed above the soil. Long well-rooted and established cuttings can be planted directly in to the sand, even on moving dunes. Young plants require watering, especially in dry periods to facilitate good establishment. Saplings are often planted close together.
Erosion control:  The species is highly valued for stabilizing sand dunes due to its fast growth, deep and extensive root system and ability to resist burial by shifting sand.
Tender branches and leaves provide high value forage, particularly during the dry period. However, a high salt content necessitates additional watering of livestock.
Apiculture: Honey is dark brown with a minty aroma.
Burns reasonably well though slow to catch fire. Used for firewood and charcoal (calorific value, 4835 kcal/kg). Leaf litter and small branches burn poorly, perhaps because of their high salt content. It gives an offensive odour if burnt green.
Fibre:  The wood chips easily with little dust being produced. Chips are of good quality and colour, suitable for manufacture of particleboard. Twigs are used for basket making.
Timber:  Wood, close-grained, light-coloured, fibrous, fairly hard, heavy (specific gravity 0.6-0.7.5) strong, density of about 700 kg/m³, high shock resistance, splits readily when first cut and polishes well. Useful for making ploughs, wheels, carts, construction, tool handles, brush-backs, ornaments, carpentry, furniture, turnery and fruit boxes.
Shade or shelter:  An important tree for shade. Very useful for obtaining temporary shelter as quickly as possible, which can be removed once the adjacent longer-term shelterbelt has attained sufficient size.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Galls, mainly from flowers are used for tanning leather. The bark is also a rich source of tannin and mordant for dyeing.
Medicine:  Flower galls are used as an astringent and gargle, bark for treating eczema and other skin diseases.
Ornamental:  Quite an attractive ornamental tree. The thin branches and blue-green leaves give a feather-like appearance and drooping clusters of delicately coloured inflorescence are attractive, used to screen farm buildings and for street planting.
Soil improver:  The tree sheds leaves and twigs abundantly forming a compact litter that improves water holding capacity of the sand. However, it is reported to have a high water output through transpiration.
Other services:  Tamarisk is used as a plant indicator for soil type in agricultural surveys. Salt drip from the leaves kill all ground vegetation beneath the tree and litter from it is too salinized to burn thus strips of the species can be grown to stop"
Tarchonanthus camphoratus,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (vaalbos,kanferbos), English (wild sage wood,wild cotton,wild camphor tree,camphor bush), Swahili (mkalambati), Zulu (amathola)
Tarchonanthus camphoratus is an evergreen shrub or small tree to 9 m tall, usually much-branched with a narrow crown; trunk diameter to 40 cm; bark brown or grey, rough, longitudinally fissured, exfoliating in long strips; young stems densely covered by white felt-like tomentum.

Tree management

T. camphoratus has a moderate growth rate, 600-800 mm/year. Coppicing is an important management practice, and T. camphoratus coppices readily. It is an invasive colonizer, use of controlled burning and grazing management or arboricides such as 2,4,5-T, picrolam and 2,4-D check its spread. Application of a mixture of picloram and 2,4-D after the late long rains from May-July proves superior in managing it, injection is suitable for single-stemmed trees of diameter approximately 5 cm, while stump treatment is employed for plants that can be utilized for charcoal and foliar application is effective depending on the stage of growth. Goat browsing also checks regrowth of T. camphoratus.
Seeds germinate within 8 weeks after sowing.

It is particularly characterized of Abies spectabilis forest, especially on limestone, but found associated with Picea smithiana, Tsuga dumosa, Pinus wallichiana and Quercus semecarpifolia, particularly at higher altitudes.
Yew is usually propagated by seeds or vegetatively through cuttings and grafting. Seed pretreatment is necessary for good germination. Germination takes a long time, and growth is slow, so that the seedlings will need two years or more in the nursery before transplanting to the field. It sprouts readily from stumps and cut branches.
Poison: Leaves are poisonous to cattle. The foliage and seeds contain several alkaloids (taxine) and glucoside (taxicatine), very poisonous, which alters to hydrotaxine by hydrolysis. In Europe, poisoning is frequent in animals such as horses, asses and mules which are extremely sensitive while rabbits, guinea-pigs and cats are insensitive. In humans, the yew generates digestive, nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, which can result in death.
 The red aril surrounding the seed can be eaten. In India, local people use the bark as a tea substitute.
Fodder: In parts of western Himalayas, the trees are lopped for cattle fodder. 
Timber: The wood is hard, fine, even-grained and moderately heavy (about 700 kg per m). The timber is very valuable and is known for its resistance against rooting. It is used mainly for turnery, marquetry and wood carvery. The colorful wood (red heartwood, white sapwood) was used to veneer furniture, to make lute bodies, bowls, tankards, combs, tool handles, pegs, and various art objects. In the UK, yew veneers is in high demand for its decorative value. In India it is used for carrying poles, bows and furniture. 
Medicine: The arilles, removed from their seeds, have diuretic and laxative effects. It was used medicinally to treat viper bites, hydrophobia (rabies), heart ailments and as an abortifascient. It is known to contain the anti-cancer drug taxol, but has not been widely exploited in this connection.
Ornamental: Currently, its principal use is as an ornamental plant in gardens and cemeteries
Yew is a very useful tree for hedging and topiary as it can be closely trimmed. It tends to become a very large bush without trimming. It is used as a windbreak.
Other services: The green twigs are used to decorate houses in Nepal during religious festivals."

Tree management

T. stans is a fast-growing tree that is easily raised and fairly drought resistant. Trees can perform well in areas of less than the recommended rainfall but need to be irrigated; they can also grow at higher altitudes than recommended, but is then said to be slow in flowering. Young plants need irrigation and protection from livestock, but once established, they can survive well on irregular watering and care. In frost-prone areas, trees are spaced 1.2 m apart and in warm climates, 2.4 m apart.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox, and seeds can be stored for long periods under ideal conditions.
The drought-resistant trees are intolerant to frost and are light demanders.
Trees are easily propagated from seeds that can be planted directly into pots, and they require no pretreatment. Seedlings require 3 to 4 months in the nursery, after which they can be directly planted out. Regeneration by cuttings is also possible.
Trees provide firewood and charcoal.

 Afrikaans (kaapse kanferfoelie), English (tecoma,kaffir honeysuckle,cape honeysuckle), Xhosa (icakatha), Zulu (uminyane,ugcangca,uchacha)
Tecomaria capensis is an evergreen scrambler to small tree with a roundish crown. Bark pale brown, lenticelled with longitudinal furrows on old stems.

Leaves opposite, unevenly compound, up to 13 cm long, with 2-5 pairs of leaflets, terminal leaflet largest, margins coarsely toothed, glossy green above.

Fruit a narrow, flat pod-like capsule up to 13 cm long. 

Seeds with large papery wings.

There are 3 garden cultivars; “coccinea” with light red flowers on a bushy plant, “lutea” with bright yellow flowers on a spreading bush and “salmonii” with salmon-coloured flowers. The genus Tecomaria is monotypic and has affinities with Tecoma.
Ecology

T. capensis occurs on forest margins but more commonly along drainage lines in dense woodland. Grows well in moist areas and in dry scrub and woodland.
Native range
Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania
Tree management

The cape honeysuckle must be pruned, to stay attractive in gardens and enhance flowering. The plant grows fast usually flowering in the second year. Growing should be done in semi shade or full sun conditions. The plant is frost tender and should be protected during the first two winters.
Seed wings removal must be done before planting.
T. capensis occurs on forest margins but more commonly along drainage lines in dense woodland. Grows well in moist areas and in dry scrub and woodland.
T. capensis is easily grown from seed, however cuttings are a more successful method. Seed should be sown in early spring or summer. The seeds are sown in a mixture of river sand and compost (1:1) covered with a thin layer of sand and kept moist. Cuttings are taken from either semi-hardwood or hardwood during autumn after the plants have flowered. The cuttings approximately 100 mm long are defoliated, save the topmost two leaves then placed in river sand. Cuttings should be misted at regular intervals to prevent drying out. Layering is also possible with T. capensis.
Erosion control:  The cape honeysuckle protects surrounding soil from erosion.
Foliage readily browsed by stock and game.
Apiculture:  The flowers are rich in nectar thus attract a number of pollinators especially sunbirds and bees. The cape honeysuckle is a rich source of sugar.
The plant can be used as firewood.
Shade or shelter:  Unpruned trees provide adequate shade 
Medicine:  Powdered bark used for treatment of fever, pneumonia and stomach troubles, also rubbed on bleeding gums to promote blood clotting. Leaf decoction used for diarrhoea and for intestinal inflammation. Believed to ease pain and produce sleep.
Ornamental:  A prized ornamental with a showy and profuse bloom, cultivated in several gardens, parks and arboreta.
The cape honeysuckle is a wonderful fencing plant with good regrowth ability after pruning and normally dense and colourful foliage over a long time.
Soil improver:  The leaf litter on decomposition improves soil fertility."
Tectona grandis,"Local names:
 Bengali (Segun,saigun), Burmese (kyun), English (teak wood,Indian oak,teak tree), Filipino (dalanang,djati), French (teck), German (tiek,Teak(holz)baum), Gujarati (sagach,saga), Hindi (saigun,sagwan,sagun), Indonesian (kulidawa,deleg,jati), Italian (teck
Tectona grandis is a large, deciduous tree reaching over 30 m in height in favourable conditions. Crown open with many small branches; the bole is often buttressed and may be fluted, up to 15 m long below the 1st branches, up to 1 m dbh. Bark is brown, distinctly fibrous with shallow, longitudinal fissures. The root system is superficial, often no deeper than 50 cm, but roots may extend laterally up to 15 m from the stem.

The very large, 4-sided leaves are shed for 3-4 months during the later half of the dry season, leaving the branchlets bare. Shiny above, hairy below, vein network clear, about 30 x 20 cm but young leaves up to 1 m long.

Flowers small, about 8 mm across, mauve to white and arranged in large, flowering heads, about 45 cm long; found on the topmost branches in the unshaded part of the crown.

Fruit is a drupe with 4 chambers; round, hard and woody, enclosed in an inflated, bladder-like covering; pale green at first, then brown at maturity. Each fruit may contain 0 to 4 seeds. There are 1 000-3500 fruits/kg.

The generic name comes from ‘tekka’, the Malabar name for T. grandis. The specific name, ‘grandis’, is Latin for ‘large’ or ‘great’.
Ecology

T. grandis will survive and grow under a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions. For example, in northern Togo it grows in a region with an annual rainfall of nearly 600 mm and in Bangladesh a region with close to 4 000 mm. It grows best in a warm, moist, tropical climate with a significant difference between dry and wet seasons. It is a pioneer species, but with a long life span. In contrast to other pioneer species, T. grandis is able to persist and dominate and to naturally regenerate towards the climax phase of succession in most parts of its natural range.

It occurs naturally in various types of tropical deciduous forests. In seasonal climates, T. grandis is deciduous, while trees grown in non-seasonal climates are semi-deciduous. It is often a dominant member of a mixed deciduous forest, where its main associates are Xylia spp., Afzelia xylocarpa, Terminalia spp. and Lagerstroemia spp. The forest floor is often covered with bamboo. T. grandis generally occurs scattered but can form almost pure stands under favourable conditions. Young plants show a remarkable capability to recover after fire.
Native range
India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand
Tree management

For plantations, stumps are planted at a spacing of 2 x 2 m. As the tree is deciduous, raising pure plantations is discouraged; rather, it is recommended to raise 80% of mixed indigenous species and the remaining 20% T. grandis. Fire protection is important; each year’s planting area should be should be protected by a fire line 10 m wide, which is cleared of all vegetation. Plantations must also be protected from grazing animals, as the soil is often susceptible to erosion. Coppicing and weeding should also be practised. T. grandis is a very strong light demander, and the optimum for its growth lies at 75-100% of full sunlight. It is intolerant of crown friction.

Initial growth of the tree is rapid. At an age of 5 years, an average height of 13 m and 10 cm dbh is not unusual; after 10 years, 16.5 m and 15 cm; after 20 years, 21.5 m and 23.5 cm. After 15 or 20 years, growth slows down. In stands of 80-year-old trees, maximum height is about 45 m, with a maximum diameter of 75 cm. Thinning takes place 4 times, at 5-, 10-, 18- and 28-year intervals after planting. The rotation period is approximately 80 years.

The average plantation yield in Java is 60-100 m³/ha, including thinning. Occasionally the final harvest may yield as much as 390 m³/ha in stands 80 years old. The mean annual volume increment is (min. 1) 3-6 (max. 15) m³/ha.
To reduce bulk in storage, the seed can be husked by rubbing it over a sieve. Another method is to load seed and large river gravel into a cement mixer. The seed can then be ‘floated’ off. Stumps, used for propagation, can be stored for up to a year.

Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability can be maintained for at least 7 years in hermetic, air-dry storage at room temperature; there is no loss in viability after 7 years in hermetic, air-dry storage at 0-4 deg. C with 12% mc. Seed can be maintained for 10 years in hermetic, air-dry storage at 2 deg. C. There are 800-2 000 seeds/kg.

T. grandis generally occurs scattered but can form almost pure stands under favourable conditions. Young plants show a remarkable capability to recover after fire.
Natural regeneration is particularly abundant in forests exposed to fires and often occurs in patches. Harvest can take place after natural abscission. In such a case, the stage of ripeness is obvious, but the seed collector is faced with the task of reaching the seed before predators remove it and also of minimizing the effort expended on harvesting poor quality or inviable seed. The best quality fruits are usually the last ones shed.

Seeds collected from the forest floor are generally used to establish plantations. It is recommended that seeds be collected from trees over 20 years old. Seed is often collected from selected stands. The general practice is to use fruits stored for a year after soaking them in water for 24 hours. Fruit that has lain dormant in the ground for 30 to 40 years has been known to germinate abundantly. If it is necessary to use fruits from the same year, they should be subjected to alternate wetting then drying for 24 hours each for 14 days. Soaking the fruit for 48 hours in running water before sowing is the best treatment for hastening germination. Another method is to char (or half burn) the fruits by covering them with a thin layer of grass and lighting it. The germination rate is low, usually less than 50%, but sometimes up to 80%. Germination usually starts after 10 days but may take 2 to 3 months.

Seedlings exhibit epigeal germination. Although teak demands strong light, it prefers slight shading during the seedling stage. In Thailand, seedlings are kept in nursery beds for about a year. Then the rootstock is dug up, the stem cut off, and the stump planted into the field. Direct sowing into the field at the beginning of the rainy season is often practised in Java.

Both grafting and budding methods showed better results than branch cutting methods. The rooting time of cutting is 8 to 15 days, and the survival rate of rooted stock is 90-100%. 

Shoots can grow to 3 m in 2 years. Tissue cultures have been perfected for T. grandis. It is possible to produce 500 plants from a single bud of a mature tree or 3000 plants from a seedling in a year. Tissue-cultured plants possess better growth than seed-grown plants.
Teakwood has been used in the manufacture of charcoal and as fuelwood, but nowadays it is usually considered too valuable for anything but pruning remnants and other rejects to be used in this way.
Timber:  A rare combination of superior physical and mechanical properties makes T. grandis a paragon of timber, and there is no likelihood of it being eclipsed by any other. The wood is a medium weight timber that is rather soft and has a characteristic appearance. The heartwood is often dull yellowish when freshly cut but turns golden brown or sometimes dark greyish-brown after exposure, often streaked grey or black. The sapwood is yellowish-white or pale yellowish-brown and up to 50 mm thick. Grain is straight, wavy or slightly interlocked, with rather coarse and uneven texture. Density of the wood is (min. 480) 610-750 (max. 850) kg/m³ at 12% mc. The wood is oily to the touch and when freshly cut has a smell reminiscent of leather.  Being classified as very resistant to teredo activity, the wood is excellent timber for bridge building and other construction in contact with water such as docks, quays, piers and floodgates in fresh water. In house building, teakwood is particularly suitable for interior and exterior joinery (windows, solid panel doors and framing) and is used for floors exposed to light to moderate pedestrian traffic. It is also used quite extensively for garden furniture. Other uses are for building poles, transmission line poles, fence posts, wallboards, beams, woodwork, boxes, musical instruments, toys, railway sleepers and railcar construction. It is brittle and therefore less suitable for articles requiring high resilience, such as tool handles and sporting goods. Its high resistance to a wide variety of chemicals makes it ideal for laboratory and kitchen tables as well as for scrubbing towers, vats, pipes and fume ducts in industrial chemical plants. The wood grains are figured well, producing an attractive veneer, which is extensively used in the manufacture of furniture and interior fittings. Teakwood is suitable for the manufacture of decorative plywood.  Larger logs are utilized for beams and sleepers, smaller ones for scantlings and battens, and thinner top ends and poles are used as round posts. Thinnings are also used for timber. The wood is very durable, difficult to preserve, saws fairly and seasons easily. For the export market, teakwood is recommended for ship decking and other constructional work in boat building. T. grandis is economically one of the most important timber tree species of Indonesia.
Tannin or dyestuff:  Both the rootbark and the young leaves produce a yellowish-brown or reddish dye, which is used for paper, clothes and matting.
Medicine:  In traditional medicine, a wood powder paste has been used against bilious headaches and swellings and internally against dermatitis or as a vermifuge. The charred wood soaked in poppy juice and made into a paste has been used to relieve the swelling of the eyelids. The bark has been used as an astringent and the wood as a hair tonic.
Ornamental:  T. grandis is occasionally cultivated in tropical countries as an ornamental for its large leaves and spreading flower clusters. The species was originally introduced into Malaysia as a roadside and ornamental tree.
Intercropping:  Soya bean mixed with T. grandis not only makes the latter grow better but also allows harvesting of the bean for food; the soya stems, roots and leaves are added to the soil as fertilizer."
Telfairia pedata,"Local names:
 Chinese (xi fei li,wen li), English (Zanzibar oil vine,queen's nut,oyster nut), French (koueme,chataigne de l'Inhambane,bane), German (talekurbis), Portuguese (sabina,castanha de l'Inhambane), Spanish (kueme), Swahili (mkweme,kweme)

Fruit green, ellipsoid with a lobed expanded base, bluntly 10-ribbed 45-60 cm long and 20 cm in diameter, weighing up to 15 kgs and dehiscent apically, containing between 70-150 seeds/fruit.

Seeds 3 cm in diameter, yellow or brown in colour, flat and nearly circular and covered with a network of fibrous material.

The generic epithet Telfairia commemorates Charles Telfair, 1778-1833, an Irish surgeon, naturalist, botanist and plant collector who sent seeds to Kew from Mauritian specimens. The specific name is derived from pedate (palmate) and means with lateral lobes divided. All 3 species of the genus are indigenous to Africa. T. pedata seems to be rapidly disappearing in Tanzania.
Ecology

T. pedata is frequently found in lowland rain forest and riverine forest.
Native range
Mozambique, Tanzania, Zanzibar
Tree management

Usually trellised until it reaches the branches of the supporting  tree, it produces very large, long, flat seeds which taste similar to almonds when roasted. The plant is a fast grower, hardy and deep rooting, within six months after planting mkweme can attain a length of up to 7 m. Commercial plantations have been successful using trellises, which must usually be strong and durable to support the massive growth and weight of the vines. The plants are spaced 15 m apart and the lines 3-4 m, ensuring yields between 3-7 tonnes per hectare. The seeds are ripe when the fruit splits.
Seeds germinate in 1-2 weeks.
T. pedata is frequently found in lowland rain forest and riverine forest.
In order to increase fecundity, vegetative propagation is necessary, to avoid an overpopulation of male plants as is the case naturally.
  The seed is eaten raw or cooked and is rich in extractable oil (61%). Nuts are especially mentioned as source of food for women during the lactating period.
After oil extraction the residue makes a valuable cake for livestock feeding.
Lipids:  The seed oil is extractable and can be used for a number of household purposes and cosmetics.
Ornamental:  T. pedata is an evergreen liane with beautiful foliage.
Intercropping:  The vine is part of a rich agroforestry system in the coffee-banana regions of Mt. Meru and Mt. Kilimanjaro."
Tephrosia candida,"Local names:

The specific name means pure white in Greek.
Ecology

The habitat of T. candida is primary and secondary forest, higher locations in sago-palm swamps and disturbed places such as roadsides, riverbanks, steep slopes and fields. It grows in the seasonally dry tropics and does not tolerate frost or waterlogging.
Native range
India
Tree management

T. candida is deep rooting and slow to establish but grows steadily thereafter. Young plants should be kept free from weeds. On poor soils, it responds well to fertilizers, especially phosphorus. On fertile soils, 25-30 t/ha of green matter can be harvested annually in 3 cuttings. Maximum growth normally takes place in the 2nd year after planting, but with regular pruning a dense cover can be maintained for many years. Spacings of 40-90 x 10 cm are reported for intercropping, depending on the associated crop.
Produces biomass of about 12-18 t/ha per year when mixed with cassava, and 20-40 t/ha per year or more in monoculture.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. No loss in viability following 3 years in either open storage or hermetic storage at room temperature with 13% ± 2% mc. There are between 300 and 500 seeds/kg.
The habitat of T. candida is primary and secondary forest, higher locations in sago-palm swamps and disturbed places such as roadsides, riverbanks, steep slopes and fields. It grows in the seasonally dry tropics and does not tolerate frost or waterlogging.
Before sowing, seed is soaked for 4-5 hours. It should be sown just before or during the rainy season. The germination rate of fresh seed is 95-100%, but viability decreases rapidly unless seeds are stored in a cool, dry place. When broadcasting, a planting density of 50 000-60 000/ha is aimed at, requiring 15-20 kg seed.
Poison: Powdered leaves are used as an insecticide. There are unconfirmed reports of the bark and roots being used as a fish poison.
The species is suitable for rehabilitating degraded land.
Erosion control: Planted to provide ground cover between perennial crops. 
Fodder: The leaves of T. candida are high in protein and can be used as fodder for pigs and cattle. 
When the species becomes woody with age, it provides suitable fuelwood.
Shade or shelter: In newly planted perennial crops such as citrus, coconut, coffee, rubber and tea, it is grown as a temporary shade crop.
Nitrogen fixing: Forms root nodules with Bradyrhizobium and fixes large amounts of atmospheric nitrogen.
Ornamental: T. candida is occasionally utilized as an ornamental. 
Suitable for making hedges along contours, around fields and homegardens, as it is not eaten by domestic animals such as buffaloes and goats. It is commonly used for hedgerows, providing mulch for different upland crops.
Soil improver: T. candida not only provides nitrogen but also raises soil phosphorus and potassium levels in proportion to increased levels of organic matter. Soil structure improves, water-holding capacity and permeability increase, and soil losses caused by water erosion decrease. It can yield well on acid soils; for example, in Vietnam, green-matter content of the soil increased from 1.7 to 4%.
Intercropping: T. candida is widely grown in mixed cultivation, for example with pineapple, maize and other annual crops, and it is said to improve the quality of tobacco. Cassava is a shade-sensitive species and needs regular lopped hedgerows, for which T. candida is a very suitable species. It has been tried as an alley crop with cassava planted in 7-m-wide interrows. Preliminary results indicate a greatly increased yield of cassava and a considerable reduction of erosion."
Tephrosia purpurea,"Local names:
 English (wild indigo,purple tephrosia,fish poison), Filipino (balba-latong), French (indigo sauvage), Gujarati (unhali), Indonesian (pohon nila hutan), Lao (Sino-Tibetan) (s'az kh'am moyz), Sanskrit (sharpunkha), Thai (ve c[as]i)
Tephrosia purpurea is an erect or spreading annual or short-lived perennial herb, sometimes bushy, 40-80 cm tall, rarely up to 1.5 m; indumentum sericeous, strigose or velutinous; stem slender, erect or decumbent at base.

Leaves imparipinnate; stipules narrowly triangular, 1.5-9 mm x 0.1-1.5 mm; rachis up to 14.5 cm long, including the petiole of up to 1 cm; petiolule 1-3 mm long; leaflets 5-25, obovate to narrowly elliptical, terminal leaflet 7-28 mm x 2-11 mm, lateral leaflets 5-30 mm x 2-11 mm, acute at base, apex rounded to emarginate, venation usually distinct on both surfaces. 

Inflorescence an axillary or leaf-opposed pseudo-raceme, (1.5-)10-15(-25) cm long, sometimes with basal leaf-like bracts; flowers in fascicles of 4-6; bracts to fascicles and to flowers small, bracteoles usually absent; pedicel 2-6 mm long; flower 4-8.5 mm long, purplish to white; calyx campanulate, persistent, cup 1.4-2.3 mm x 1.5-3.2 mm, unequally 4-toothed, teeth pubescent inside; standard broadly ovate, 3.5-7.3 mm x 5-10 mm, clawed; wings 2.5-6 mm x 1.5-3.8 mm, auricled on vexillary side, clawed; keel 2.2-4.5 mm x 2-3 mm, auricled on vexillary side, clawed; stamens 10, staminal tube 4-6 mm long, filaments alternately longer and shorter, free part up to 3.5 mm long, vexillary filament free at base, connate halfway, 5-8 mm long; style up to 4.5 mm long, upper half glabrous, stigma penicillate at base. 

Pod flat, linear, 2-4.5 cm x 3-5 mm, somewhat up-curved towards the end, convex around the seeds, flattened between, margins thickened, dehiscent with twisted valves, 2-8(-10)-seeded.

Seed rectangular to transversely ellipsoid, 2.5-5 mm x 1.8-3 mm, light to dark brown to black, sometimes mottled.

T. purpurea is a very variable species and many subclassifications exist. Most characteristic is the shape of its pod: convex around the seeds with a distinctive flat area in between. The name T. purpurea is often erroneously applied to the cultivated T. noctiflora Bojer ex Baker which has longer inflorescences, a very long carinal calyx tooth and reticulately ridged seeds.

For South-East Asia T. purpurea is subclassified as follows; (a) subsp. barbigera Bosman & de Haas: vexillary filament and staminal tube   velutinous; occurring in the Philippines, New Guinea and Australia. Based on flower and inflorescence lengths, further subdivided into 2 varieties: var. barbigera (flower 7-8 mm long, longest inflorescence 11-19.5 cm long) and var. rufescens Benth. (flower 5-6 mm long,   longest inflorescence 4.5-11 cm long). (b) subsp. purpurea : characteristics and distribution as described for the   species; vexillary filament and staminal tube glabrous.
Ecology

T. purpurea occurs naturally in grassy fields, waste places and thickets, on ridges, and along roadsides, in Java. In Hawaii, it grows near the seashore.
Native range
Australia, China, India, Sri Lanka
Tree management

T. purpurea is associated with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus heterosporum and Sclerocystis microcarpus in waste sites of coal mines and calcite mine spoils, and is nodulated by Rhizobium.

Its growth is often not very luxuriant, limiting its value as a temporary shade crop or green manure. When added to the soil as green manure it increases humus content and induces the formation of large, stable soil aggregates. It produces ample seed and builds up a large seedbank in the soil.
 
T. purpurea occurs naturally in grassy fields, waste places and thickets, on ridges, and along roadsides, in Java. In Hawaii, it grows near the seashore.
T. purpurea can easily be propagated by seed.
Poison: The toxic properties of T. purpurea are due to the presence of flavonoids; those recorded include rotenone and several of its isomers named deguelins. One of the deguelins, tephrosin, is poisonous to fish, but not to mammals. The leaves contain up to 2.5% rutin (a flavonol glucoside). Pounded leaves are used to stupefy and catch fish.
Fodder: Information on the fodder value of T. purpurea is conflicting. In India and in South Africa, it is used as a fodder before flowering, but in Australia it is reported to cause livestock poisoning.
The energy value of the wood of T. purpurea is 14 500 kJ/kg. In northern India, dry plants are collected for fuel.
Shade or shelter: It is applied as temporary shade.
Tannin or  dyestuff: The leaves are occasionally used to dye orange-brown, or, in a mixture with Mucuna cyanosperma Schumann, black.
Medicine: Medicinally, all parts of the plant have tonic and laxative properties. The dried plant is deobstruent, diuretic and useful in treating bronchitis, bilious febrile attacks and obstructions of the liver, spleen and kidneys. It is also recommended as a blood purifier, in the treatment of boils and pimples and is considered a cordial treatment. In southern India, a decoction of the fruit is given against intestinal worms and a fruit extract is used to relieve bodily pains and inflammatory problems. The roots are bitter and a decoction is used as a nematicide for treatment against Toxocora canis larvae which cause a lung disease in Sri Lanka; it is also used against dyspepsia, colic, and chronic diarrhoea and as anthelminthic. 
Soil improver: T. purpurea is used as green manure for vegetables, rice, coconut and banana, especially in India and Sri Lanka, and on a more limited scale in Indonesia, Malaysia and southern China. When grown as a green manure on saline-sodic soils in Rajastan (India), it is most successful in reducing soil salinity and lowering the pH."

Tree management

Under favourable conditions, T. vogelii grows fast and is tolerant to repeated pruning. It is also tolerant to drought, strong wind and grazing, although drought often stops resprouting. Burning has little effect on T. vogelii, as it resprouts readily due to its deep root system. If the plants are weakly branched, they should be lopped to promote branching. 

For a green-manure crop, the recommended spacing is 40 cm x 40 cm, with 2-3 seeds per hole; when planted for hedges the spacing should be 1.5 m between the rows. For large plantations, sufficient seedlings should be available for replanting in case of a low survival rate. When sown in rows, the recommended sowing rate is 5 kg/ha and when broadcast 8-13 kg/ha. Planting should be done at the beginning or in the middle of the rainy season.
Orthodox seed storage behaviour; no loss in viability over 2-3 years in open storage. Air-dried seed can be stored in sealed containers for at least 1.5 years. Preferably, fresh seed should be stored for 2 months before planting.

Commonly propagated by seed. Without treatment, the germination percentage is 65%, and the seedling survival rate about 60%. Soaking in warm water (45 deg. C) stimulates germination.
Poison: Cultivated for insecticide, fish and arrow poison obtainable from the leaves. The poison stupefies fish, which are then easily caught. Dry, crushed leaves are used as insecticide against lice, fleas and ticks, and as a molluscicide. Tephrosine is the poisonous principal.
Shade or shelter: T. vogelii is cultivated in Indonesia as a green manure, windbreak and temporary shade crop in cocoa, coffee, tea, rubber and cinchona plantations.
Medicine: Used as an abortifacient, emetic, bactericide, purgative and cure for skin diseases, schistosomiasis, ringworm and parasitic infections. Leaf decoctions are used in the treatment of scabies and yaws; a weak infusion of the leaves is taken as an anthelmintic. Root decoctions are used to treat constipation.
Nitrogen fixing: A known nitrogen-fixing species.
Ornamental: Its variously coloured flowers make it suitable as an ornamental.
Because of its dense growth, it is suitable as a hedge plant.
Soil improver: In central Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines and peninsular Malaysia it is used as green manure, e.g. in coconut plantations. The nitrogen content is 3.7 g/100 g dry matter in plants 2-3 months old, falling to 1.2 g in 10-month-old material, while the phosphorus content drops from 0.8 g to 0.2 g."

The generic name Terminalia comes from Latin word ‘terminus’ or ‘terminalis’ (ending), and refers to the habit of the leaves being crowded or borne on the tips of the shoots.
Ecology

It occurs naturally along banks of streams and rivers and seasonally dry water courses at low elevations. The species is a characteristic component of dry tropical riverine forests and tropical moist and dry deciduous forests
Native range
India, Sri Lanka
Tree management

Arjun, an initial slow-grower, later grows very fast to attain 2–3 m height in 3 years. Weeding and protection from fire and frost is needed for the first two years. Pruning is required to remove the weaker shoots when forking takes place due to frost damage. Selection management systems can be utilized to extract timber, which is 50-60 cm dbh.

Arjun has been successfully grown in taungya plantations. Plantations established in India for tasar sericulture, have a spacing of 1 x 2 m, and are managed by repeated pollarding. It also coppices strongly if cut when smaller than approximately 76 cm dbh, yielding poles, posts and firewood. It produces root suckers and is suitable for pollarding.
Ripe fruits can be collected from the trees themselves or from the ground below trees. They are usually dried in the shade for a month, and the fibrous ribs are usually reduced by rubbing with the hands.

Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. The mature seeds are viable for 1 year when stored in dry gunny bags or in open or closed glass bottles
It occurs naturally along banks of streams and rivers and seasonally dry water courses at low elevations. The species is a characteristic component of dry tropical riverine forests and tropical moist and dry deciduous forests
T. arjuna is usually propagated through seeds, coppicing, root-suckers, stumps and air-layering. Natural regeneration rarely occurs in semi-arid habitats due to lack of enough moisture. 

Seeds germinate early in the rainy season. Sun-exposed seeds germinate less-readily. They are soaked in hot water for 1 minute and left in cold water for 48 hours before sowing. Germination process takes 50–76 days, during which 50–60% of the seeds germinate

Direct sown plants tend to tolerate mid-season drought better than nursery seedlings. However, direct seeding is not recommended in dry areas unless irrigation is feasible, in case of a break in the monsoon. 

Roots of older seedlings can become too long and are better when made into stumps. Normally 15-month-old seedlings are used for preparing stumps. A collar diameter of about 1.2-2.5 cm is considered as the optimum size for planting stumps.
Arjan is usually used in agro and social forestry for reclamation of saline, alkaline soils and deep ravines as well as in sand dune afforestation programmes with Casuarina species.
Erosion control: The species is commonly found and planted along the banks of rivers, streams, old irrigation channels, edges of tank bunds and alluvial bars in seasonally dry water courses, helping to reduce soil erosion on the banks through its root-mass.
Fodder: It is widely planted for raising tassar silkworm and livestock fodder in India where leaves are heavily lopped. The leaves contain 9-11% crude protein and 14-20% crude fibre. 
It makes excellent charcoal and firewood, with calorific values of 5030 Kcal/kg and 5128 Kcal/kg for the sapwood and heartwood, respectively.
Timber: The sapwood is pinkish-white and the heartwood is brown to dark-brown, very hard, lustrous, strong and heavy (specific gravity 0.74; weight 816-865 kg/mn). The odourless, coarse-textured wood is streaked with dark lines and has irregularly inter-locked grains. Timber is locally used for carts, agricultural implements, water troughs, traps, boat building, house building, electric poles, tool-handles and jetty-piles. It also provides satisfactory rayon-grade pulp in mixture with other woods.
Shade or shelter: It is planted for shade or ornament in avenues and parks.
Tannin or dyestuff: The bark (22–24%), primarily, and fruit (7–20%) are used as tanning and dyeing material. The tannage can be used for making fine upper leather and excellent sole leather of light-brown or buff colour with a red tint. It yields up to 45 kg dry bark chips on a three-year cycle without injury, as it is reproduced after 2 rainy seasons.
Medicine: T. arjuna has been widely used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of cancer, dermatological and gynaecological complaints, heart diseases and urinary disorders. The bark is acrid, an astringent and tonic, and is useful in treatment of high blood pressure and ulcers. The cancer cell growth inhibitory constituent (luteolin) has been isolated from bark, stem and leaves of T. arjuna. Luteolin has also been shown to have specific anti-bacterial activity against Neisseria gonorrhoea. It can also be used as alexiteric, styptic, tonic and anthelmintic and it is useful in fractures, inflammation and wounds and ulcers.
Ornamental: This tree is often planted on roadsides and, and is also used for ornamentation.
Intercropping: T. arjuna is an agroforestry species, often intercropped with coconut and citrus. It is also an excellent shade tree, especially in coffee plantations.
Other services: The leaves or flowers have sacred value in India. The astrologers associate the plant with constellation Swati whose presiding deity is Vayu.
Pollution control: It is also planted near wells as roots of T. arjuna are believed to purify and cool the water in the wells."

It is frequently found in monsoon forests, mixed deciduous forests or dry deciduous dipterocarp forests, associated with teak (Tectona grandis)
T. bellirica is usually propagated by direct seeding or nursery-raised container seedlings. Regeneration is plentiful within the natural and artificial stands but is affected by destruction of seeds by insects, birds and animals. Artificial regeneration in India has been achieved by direct sowing and transplanting of nursery-raised stock. Seed is sometimes broadcast to supplement natural regeneration. The root-shoot cuttings or stump planting give good results. Germination occurs within 10-45 days after sowing and the nursery phase is about 3-4 months.
 The kernels of the fruit can be eaten but are somewhat dangerous as they have a narcotic effect.
Fodder. The leaves are highly valued and extensively used as fodder. The farmers lopp side branches, often sparing the main limbs to ensure good growth and future supplies of fodder. The chemical composition improves with the stage of maturity in leaves, which are on the whole considered to be nutritious, palatable and digestible. Leaves contain 9- 14% crude proteins and can be used to rear tussar silkworms (Antherea mylitta).
The tree yields a good-quality firewood and charcoal with calorific value of sapwood being 5000 kcal/kg.
Timber: The wood is whitish, rather soft, with a density of 675-900 kg/m3 at 12% moisture content; sapwood and heartwood are not distinct with straight grains. The wood is steeped in water to make it more durable then used for making boxes, furniture and construction.
Dyestuff or tannins: The fruit produces tannins and dyes used for leather tanning, dyeing of clothes, matting and inks
Cosmetic: The kernel produces a non-edible oil used in toilet soap and is good for hair.
Medicine: The fruit rind (pericarp) is astringent, laxative, anthelmintic, pungent, germicidal and antipyretic. It is applied in a diverse range of conditions including cough, tuberculosis, eye diseases, anti-HIV-1, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dysentery, inflammation of the small intestine, biliousness, flatulence, liver disease, leprosy, cleanse the blood and promote hair growth in the Ayurvedic drug. Fruit extracts have anti-bacterial activity against Micrococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli.
Ornamental: It is grown as an avenue tree.
Intercropping: It has been grown in taungya plantations along with agricultural crops, which may be grown for 2-3 years between the lines of trees generally 3-4 m apart."

Seeds are viable for only about 3 weeks.
The tree is found in lowland forest, secondary miombo woodland such as clearing and gaps, and open woodland. Grows in well-drained escarpments, with infertile sand or gravel soils of acidic reaction. Frost-free sites are most ideal.
Natural regeneration may be the most reliable method; it regenerates easily from seed or root suckers. As seed does not long remain viable, it must be sown fresh. Germination is good and natural regeneration adequate. Germination prospects are improved by scarification, manual nicking, complete endocarp removal, or soaking for 24 hours in water at room temperature. Successful nursery establishment requires mycorrhizal inoculation, using soil from natural stands of the tree. Seedlings should be raised in partial shade for the 1st few months. Also propagated by cuttings.
Poison: The leaves are used as a cockroach repellent in homes.
Erosion control: As a dominant or codominant tree of the miombo vegetation in hilly sites, it is useful in watershed management.

The generic name ‘Vangueria’ is derived from a Malagasy word, and ‘infausta’ means unlucky; making fire with the wood is taboo.
Ecology

V. infausta is found in all types of woodland, especially on rocky ridges and hillsides or in wooded grassland; also near the sea on sand dunes. It can withstand long periods of drought and frost. Widely distributed in savannah-like communities derived from forest (including forest remnants), and often in rocky or sandy places.
Native range
Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Young plants transplant well but must receive regular watering for the 1st 5 weeks after transplanting. They are light demanding, and the growth rate is usually slow; 40-50 cm/year. Groups of V. infausta can be planted scattered in fields, near water points and along homestead fences. The flowers attract insects, which in turn attract insect-eating birds.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seed can retain viability for up to 1 year in storage if dried properly. There are about 500 seeds/kg.

Widely distributed in savannah-like communities derived from forest (including forest remnants), and often in rocky or sandy places.
The species regenerates naturally by suckers, coppice and, rarely, by seed. Soak seeds overnight and plant the following morning in seedling trays filled with river sand and cover with a thin layer of sand. Germination rate is good (usually 80% or more), and cracking the hard seed coat may increase the rate, but germination takes a long time. Transfer seedlings to nursery bags when they reach the 3-leaf stage and keep them for at least 1 year before planting them into the field. Cuttings can be made from the present year’s growth, but they must be treated with a root-stimulating hormone powder. Plant them during early spring in river sand.
 The fruits are eaten raw and the pulp sometimes soaked in water and then dried to use later. The pulp, when mixed with a little sugar and water, makes a good substitute for applesauce; it has a sweet and slightly sour taste. Each 100 g fresh fruit contain 3.7 g vitamin C, 1.4 g protein, 28 g carbohydrate, 28 mg sodium, 0.61 mg nicotinic acid and high levels of calcium and magnesium. Seeds can be eaten roasted.
Fodder: The leaves of V. infausta are seldom browsed by cattle, but very much so by goats, and the leaves and young branches are eaten by elephant, giraffe, kudu and nyala. Red-footed squirrels, bushbabies, vervet monkeys and baboons eat the fruit on the tree, and bushpig eat it on the ground.
V. infausta is a good source of firewood.
Timber: Poles for houses, agricultural implements and handles are some of the ways in which the wood is utilized.
Medicine: Traditional healers use the roots for a variety of illnesses such as malaria and pneumonia. An infusion made from the roots is used to treat coughs and other chest troubles. A decoction from the root is used as a purgative and an anthelmintic (especially for Ascaris), and is also a popular snakebite remedy. The pounded leaves are applied to tick-bite sores on livestock and dogs to speed up healing. A poultice made of the leaves is used to treat swellings on the legs and inflammation of the navel in children. An infusion of the leaves is used in treating abdominal pain and for the relief of dental pain. In southern Africa, a decoction is used as a remedy for menstrual troubles.
Alcohol: In South Africa, farmers distil ‘mampoer’ from the ripe fruit."

V. madagascariensis regenerates naturally from coppice and seed. Seed germination is difficult owing to the hard seed coat. The ripe fruit is persistent and needs to be picked directly from the tree. Unripe fruit can also be picked and stored for several days before ripening. Seeds germinate well but sporadically (taking up to 6 weeks); nicking the seed or soaking it in cold water overnight may hasten germination.
 The ripe fruit pulp is edible and has a pleasant chocolate-like flavour. The fruit is also used to add flavour to beer.
Apiculture: The pleasant-smelling flowers of V. madagascariensis attract bees, and are therefore a suitable honey source. 
This multibranched shrub or tree is popular as a source of both firewood and charcoal.
Timber: Wood is suitable for building construction, tool handles and carving. 
Medicine: Roots and bark are used in traditional medicine; for example, in Tanzania an extract from the roots is used to treat worm infections."

Leathery, medium to dark green, with or without sparse hairs above, with fine, soft, pale hairs below and conspicuous net-veining; apex and base tapering, base always almost symmetric, margin entire or very finely toothed; petiole usually very short but may be 1-2 cm long.

Flower heads thistlelike, small, creamy-white, sometimes slightly touched with mauve, about 10 mm long, grouped in dense heads, axillary and terminal, forming large flat clusters about 15 cm in diameter but not conspicuous; sweetly scented, especially in the evening.

Fruit a small nutlet, with minute glands and bristly hairs on the body and a long tuft of bristly hairs at the top.

The genus was named in honour of an English botanist, William Vernon, traveller and plant collector in North America in the 17th century. The specific name means ‘like an almond’—the allusion is not clear.

Erosion control: Soil conservation is enhanced with this tree.
 Leaves, although rather bitter to taste, are eaten as raw vegetables. ‘Chewsticks’ from the roots and twigs are regarded as an appetizer.
Fodder: Produces a large mass of forage from the leaves and shoots and therefore is a good fodder species.
Apiculture: Produces very light, fine flavoured honey.
Both firewood and charcoal are derived form V. amygdalina.
Timber: The genus Vernonia is a well-known group of timber trees.
Medicine: An infusion from the roots is given to children suffering from infection by a trematode (Enterobius vermicularis). A cold infusion of the root bark, together with other plants, is given in daily doses to treat bilharzia. The bark and root are taken as a tonic by people suffering from fevers; leaves are also pounded, the juice extracted and drunk for fever. The leaves are pounded and mixed with warm water for bathing to treat spots on the skin and nausea.
Ornamental: Useful as an ornamental.
The termite-resistant branches are useful as stakes for lining out plantations and as a live fence.
Other services: A drought and termite resistant tree."
Vitellaria paradoxa,"Local names:
 Arabic (lulu), English (sheanut tree,shea-butter tree,shea tree,bambouk butter tree,galam butter tree), French (karité,arbre a beurre,beurre de galam,beurre/graisse de karité), Fula (balire,kareje), German (Schibutterßaum,Sheabutterßaum), Hausa (man ka’d
Vitellaria paradoxa is a small to medium-sized tree (min. 7) 10-15 (max. 25) m high; much branched, dense, spreading, round to hemispherical crown. In mature trees the bole is short, usually 3-4 m but exceptionally 8 m, with a diameter ranging from 0.3 to 1 m, but most frequently 0.6 m. Bark conspicuously thick, corky, horizontally and longitudinally deeply fissured; protects older trees against bush fires. Slash pale pink, secreting white latex, as do broken twigs or petioles.

Leaves in dense clusters, spirally arranged at the end of stout twigs. They are covered by thick bark showing numerous leaf scars. Petioles 5-15 cm long, leaves oblong. Juvenile leaves rust-red and pubescent, later coriaceous, glabrous and dark green, shining, 12-25 cm long and 4-7 cm wide, leaf margin wavy and bent.

The flowers develop in the axils of scale leaves, at the extremities of dormant twigs, from buds formed 2 years previously. Inflorescence a dense fascicle 5-7.5 cm in diameter, at the end of a flowering twig, each usually containing 30-40 flowers, though 80-100 have been recorded. Individual flowers white or creamy-white, about 1.5 cm in diameter and subtended by scarious, brown, ovate or lanceolate bracteoles, which are abscised before flower opening.

Fruit 5-8 cm long and 3-4 cm wide, elliptic, a yellow-green or yellow berry with thick butter-like, mucous pericarp; generally containing only 1 oval or round red-brown seed (the shea nut), surrounded by a fragile shining shell with a large, round, rough hilum on a broad base.

The genus Vitellaria is considered by botanical authorities as monospecific, two subspecies are recognized ssp. paradoxa restricted to Western Africa and ssp. nilotica of Eastern Africa.
Ecology

The shea tree is a light-demanding species of open sites and parkland savannah; forming extensive pure stands in some areas but often also associated with other trees, such as Parkia biglobosa (nere). Avoids swampy areas, those liable to flooding for any length of time, moist heavy loam soils or watercourses. The extensive root system is essential for survival in the 5-7-month dry seasons of savannah climates. Can withstand quite severe fires.
Native range
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Togo, Uganda
Tree management

Wide spacing, site preparation and elimination of weed competition, as well as protection against fire and browsing, are essential. The tree grows relatively slowly at first; growth rates can be accelerated by adding compost and fertilizer. In the Sahel, successful cultivation can be attempted only on sites with a good water supply, for example, along seasonal watercourses. The 1st fruits are borne 3-4 years after flowering, and trees do not start to bear fruit until they are 15-20 years old.

Because of its value as a source of oil, Vitellaria has long been an integral component of wooded farmland agriculture. Often, it is the only tree to be spared when woodland is cleared for cultivation. These preserved specimens may be as much as 150-200 years old.
The seeds of Vitellaria are recalcitrant; viability falls rapidly a week after removal from the fruit and is lost completely within 3-6 weeks. Ripe fruit that falls directly to the ground germinates easily if the soil is moist, but many seedlings succumb to drought and bush fires. Germination is cryptogeal; that is, the shoots arise from belowground even though the seed germinate on the surface.

Avoids swampy areas, those liable to flooding for any length of time, moist heavy loam soils or watercourses. The extensive root system is essential for survival in the 5-7-month dry seasons of savannah climates. Can withstand quite severe fires.
Fresh seeds germinate well. Growing directly in situ is sometimes recommended because of the long taproot and transplanting difficulties. Seedlings raised in pots should be out-planted after 14-24 weeks, plants raised in seedbeds after 12 months as balled planting stock. Air-layering is possible but difficult. Grafting methods have been developed and show a 25% success rate, provided the grafts are not water stressed and that latex does not block the graft-stock union.
Wax: The high melting point of the fat renders it especially suitable for candle manufacture.
Poison: Waste water from traditional shea-butter extraction is believed to keep white ants away. Traditionally, shea butter, at a rate of 5 ml oil/kg of seed, has been shown to protect Vigna subterranea against Callosobruchus maculatus. A root-bark extract (100 ppm) is effective against Bulinus globosus; when mixed with tobacco, the roots are used as a poison by the Jukun of northern Nigeria. Infusions of the bark have selective antimicrobial properties, being effective against Sarcina lutea and Staphyllococus aureus.
Erosion control: It regenerates well, and is traditionally favoured and protected by farmers. As a result, it has played a significant role in soil and water conservation and environmental protection in semi-arid West Africa.
 Shea butter extracted from the nuts is one of the most affordable and widely used vegetable fats in the Sahel. Today, shea nuts are important internationally and are sold to European and Japanese food industries. The refined fat is sold as baking fat, margarine and other fatty spreads under various trade names and finds increasing use in various foodstuffs. Shea butter has a fatty composition similar to that of cocoa butter, so is often used as a substitute for cocoa, and in pastry because it makes a highly pliable dough. Traditionally prepared unpurified, shea butter is sold in ‘loaves’ in markets and, if properly prepared and wrapped in leaves, is resistant to oxidative rancidity and will keep for years if not exposed to air and heat. Nuts that have been cleaned and lightly sun dried without previous maceration yield a tasteless, odourless fat. Traditionally prepared shea butter, after refining, is also tasteless and odourless. The edible fruit pulp constitutes 50-80% of the whole fruit. It is allowed to become slightly overripe before being eaten raw; it can also be eaten lightly cooked. Children eat the nuts raw, while the flowers are made into fritters by some ethnic groups. Caterpillars of Cirina butyrospermii A. Vuilet, which feed exclusively on the leaves of the shea-butter tree, are dried and sold in markets in Nigeria and Senegal. They are rich in protein and sometimes eaten in a sauce.
Fodder: Shea-nut cake is increasingly used for livestock and poultry feed. Leaves and young sprouts serve as forage. Sheep and pigs eat the sugary pulp of ripe fruit that have fallen to the ground.
Apiculture: The tree is much sought after for placing hives in traditional apiculture. Vitellaria furnishes the bees with a great quantity of nectar and pollen.
Excellent-quality firewood that burns with a fierce heat. The charcoal is not good quality, however; it burns rapidly and is friable and, although it provides enough heat for domestic use, is not suitable for iron-working. The sticky black residue from fat extraction can also be used as a substitute for kerosene when lighting firewood. Due to its value as a fruit tree, V. paradoxa is seldom cut for fuel.
Timber: Wood brownish-red, darkens readily on exposure; strong, hard, heavy, durable, resilient, and weathers and wears well. Despite its hardness, it saws and planes well, takes an excellent polish, and glues, nails and screws well, but preboring is advisable to prevent splitting. Wood is used in engineering structures, house posts and support poles, also in ship building, for shingles, stakes and fencing, sleepers, medium and heavy-duty flooring, joinery, seats, household utensils, durable platters and bowls, pestles and mortars and tool handles. It is termite resistant.
Tannin or dyestuff: Ashes from burnt wood are commonly used as the dye.
Lipids: The shea-butter tree is an important oil-producing plant, especially as it occurs where other such plants are rare. It is also useful in soap making, but it is unique in having a high fraction of oil (8%) that does not convert into soap; this fraction has numerous medicinal qualities. The sticky black residue that remains after the clarification of butter is used for filling cracks in hut walls.
Medicine: Shea butter protects against sunburn, so is a useful ingredient in sun-protection or post-sun-exposure products. It also encourages wound healing and soothes skin irritation. Shea butter is stable and permits the fast release of medicaments; it can therefore be used as a base for suppositories and ointments. Shea butter is traditionally used in medicines, particularly for the preparation of skin ointments, and is used to treat inflammation, rashes in children, dermatitis, sunburn, chapping, irritation, ulcers and as a rub for rheumatism. Leaf decoctions are used for stomach-ache, headache and as an eye lotion. Roots and root bark are ground to a paste and taken orally to cure jaundice, or are boiled and pounded to treat chronic sores and girth sores in horses. They are also used for the treatment of diarrhoea and stomach-ache. A bark decoction is used in a bath to facilitate childbirth in Cote d’Ivoire; it is drunk to encourage lactation after delivery, although in northern Nigeria such a concoction is said to be lethal. A bark infusion is used as an eyewash as a footbath to help extract jiggers, and to neutralize the venom of the spitting cobra. Infusions have been taken for the treatment of leprosy in Guinea-Bissau and for gastric problems as well as for diarrhoea and dysentery. Macerated with the bark of Ceiba pentandra and salt, infusions have been used to treat cattle with worms in Senegal and Guinea. Tapinanthus globifera, one of the most common parasitic plants on Vitellaria, also has many medicinal uses.
Soil improver: The husks of the seeds make a good mulch and fertilizer.
Intercropping: V. paradoxa can be combined well with many cereal crops.
Latex or rubber: The latex is heated and mixed with palm oil to make a glue. Latex obtained from the bark of the trees could be used as a chewing-gum base, but it does not have a very pleasant taste. Washing improves the taste but detracts from the chewin
Pollution control: Studies on the byproducts of shea-butter processing have shown that heavy-metal ions can be removed from aqueous solutions, for example waste water, using Vitellaria seed husks."

Ecology

In its natural range, it has the greatest stocking in moist lowland areas. It is common, as a co-dominant species in lowland forests with distinct wet and dry seasons and very light-demanding.
Native range
Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Planting should be done early in the rainy season at a spacing of 1 m x 3 m. Young trees grow moderately slowly. Survival of young seedlings is enhanced by removing weeds 3-4 months after planting and thereafter annually up to 10 years. Stand establishment is through planting stock and wildings.
Ripe fruits can be collected from the trees by climbing. In young trees a pole pruner or a long stick can be used to collect the fruits. Collection from the ground should avoid fruits attacked by fungi or insects. The fruits are soaked in water and the pulp removed manually by squeezing the fruit. The seeds (stones) are then washed in water and spread out in a thin layer on trays in the sun for 2-3 days before storage. The seeds storage behaviour is Intermediate. There are about 10000 seeds/kg.
In its natural range, it has the greatest stocking in moist lowland areas. It is common, as a co-dominant species in lowland forests with distinct wet and dry seasons and very light-demanding.
The seed are pretreated by soaking in hot water (70ºC) for 10 minutes and allowing to cool for 24 hours can enhance the germination rate up to 70%. Seeds are sown in a seedbed with a germination medium of soil and sand mixture (1:2 composition). The seeds are sown at 1 cm within the rows and 15 cm between the rows. Germination is epigeal (cotyledons emerge above ground).

Seed start to germinate 10-40 days after sowing. After about 2 months in the seedbed, the seedlings are transferred to 12 x 18 cm polybags. Seedlings are planted in the field at the start of the rainy season, when they are 3-4 months old.
Apiculture: It is a source of bee forage.
Timber: V. cofassus is a sought after and useful hardwood. It is exported in fairly large amounts from Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, mainly to Japan.

Ecology

V. payos is a species of hot, low and semi-arid places with high water table. In more arid zones it is found near rock outcrops. The most commonly associated tree species are Acacia polyacantha, Dalbergia melanoxylon, Brachystegia spiciformis etc.
Native range
Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Partial clearing of vegetation is essential before planting out to open up space. Tending should include spot weeding and slashing until the crop is well established. The tree coppices well.
Seed germination is hindered by the hard seed coat. This is normally broken by annual fires in the wild.

Vitex pubescens,"Local names:
 Burmese (kyetyoh), English (hairy-leafed molave), Indonesian (laban,kalapapa,gulimpapa), Malay (tinnok,samo-tinpet,leban tandok,leban buas,kulim papa), Thai (tinnok,samo-tinpet), Vietnamese (b[if]nh linh l[oo]ng)
Vitex pubescens is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, up to 25(-30) m tall, often with a crooked bole, up to 70 cm in diameter at breast height; bark surface smooth, shallowly fissured or flaky, pale grey to yellowish-brown, inner bark pale yellow to bright orange; branches quadrangular, crown often spreading.

Leaves opposite, compound, (3-)5 foliolate; leaflets and petioles pubescent below; lateral leaflet sessile or nearly so, elliptic, 10-20 cm long.

Inflorescence terminal, paniculate, with prominent bracts; calyx cup-shaped, 5-lobed, lobes subequal, c. 2 mm long, flowers bisexual, zygomorphic, corolla bluish-white to violet, 0.8-1.25 cm long, 2-lipped, upper lip 2-lobed, lower lip much larger and 3-lobed, pubescent outside; stamens 4, inserted on the corolla tube, exserted, didynamous. Ovary superior, 2-4-chambered, with 1 filiform style having a bifid stigma.

Fruit a drupe, subglobose, 7-13 mm in diameter, purplish-black when mature, sessile on the often enlarged calyx, 1-4 seeded.

Seed obovoid or oblong, lacking endosperm.

The specific epithet pubescens means hairy.
Ecology

V. pubescens is common in comparatively dry regions in lowland forest, especially in more open habitats, secondary forests and river banks. It occurs gregariously in secondary forest and is a pioneer species in Imperata cylindrica (alang-alang) vegetation and recently burnt grasslands; it is moderately fire resistant.
Native range
Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam
Tree management

Planting should be done early in the rainy season. Generally at 1 m x 3 m , occasionally at 1 m x 1-2 m on very fertile soils. Young trees grow moderately slowly, with a mean annual diameter increment of 0.6 cm and slightly over 1 cm in Myanmar and Java respectively. 1-year-old seedlings may reach 2 m in height, mean annual height increment for the first 15 years after planting is about 1 m. Survival of young seedlings is enhanced by removing weeds 3-4 months after planting and thereafter annually up to 10 years. For charcoal production, stands planted at densities of 2 500 trees/ha have yielded 16-18 tons of charcoal in 4 years.
There are 10 000-12 000 seeds/kg. Seeds start to germinate 10-40 days after sowing with a germination rate of 60-80 %. Soaking seeds in hot water for 15 seconds stimulates and increases germination. Seed can be stored for 1 year after depulping. Under dense forest canopy germination is completely inhibited, but seeds remain dormant and viable for more than 6 months. Seed under light shade differentiates into 2 fractions: one with seeds germinating within 2 months, the other with seeds remaining dormant and only germinating when exposed to full sunlight.

V. trifolia is found in teak forest, secondary forest and thickets up to 1100 m altitude, but also in mangrove forest and along the shore.  The phenotypic variation observed between these habitats is given specific or sub-specific rank by various authors.
Germination of V. trifolia seed is reported to be difficult.
Poison:  Oils from the leaves of V. trifolia show considerable mosquito repellent activity.  The active principle in the leaves of V. trifolia has been identified as rotundinal, a cycloterpene aldehyde. V. trifolia shows considerable potential as a botanical pesticide that may be applied both indoors and outdoors.
Medicine: A poultice of leaves is used to treat rheumatism, contusions, swollen testicles, and as a discutient in sprains.  An infusion of the boiled roots is regarded as diaphoretic and diuretic, and is widely drunk in cases of fever and after childbirth.  In Malaysia, various parts of the plants are considered a panacea for a wide variety of illnesses ranging from headache to tuberculosis.  In Indonesia, the leaves are used in medicinal baths and a tincture or decoction of them for intestinal complaints, whereas the fruits are used as an anthelmintic.  In the Bismarck Archipelago, the sap from crushed heated leaves is diluted with water and drunk to relieve headaches.  In Vietnam, a decoction of dried fruits is given in the treatment of common cold, headache, watery eyes and mastitis.  In Thailand, the fruits are used to treat asthmatic cough and haemorrhoids, and the root is applied in the treatment of liver diseases.  An ethanol extract (50%) of V. trifolia shows antispasmodic and antihistamine properties.  A crude drug extract of V. trifolia leaves mediated a significant increase in lifespan in mice bearing sarcoma 180 cells, indicating potential antitumour activity.
Ornamental: V. trifolia are widely cultivated as ornamentals.
V. trifolia is often used as a hedge plant, altough it may trigger various allergic reactions (sneezing, respiratory problems, dizziness, headache, nausea) to people trimming or pruning such hedges.
Essential oil: The essential oil contains several terpenes, including cineol, terpineol and alpha-pinene."
Vochysia guatemalensis,"Local names:
 Creole (yemeni,emeri), English (white yemeri,white mahogany), Spanish (san Juan peludo,san Juan,palo de agua,mayo blanco,chancho), Trade name (white mahogany)
Vochysia guatemalensis is a medium to large tree, 30-55 m tall with diameter of 0.5-1.5 m. The bole is cylindrical and sometimes bifurcate, with smooth and pale bark. The crown is rounded or depressed, the branchlets glabrous; stipules sublate, 3 mm long.

Leaves simple, 3-4 verticilate or the uppermost opposite, on petioles 2-3 cm long, oblong - lanceolate 9-15 cm long, 2.5-5.5 cm wide, dark and bright green, rather abruptly acuminate or long acuminate, acuminate at the base, coriaceous, glabrous.

Flowers terminal clusters, in erect inflorescences, bright yellow and fragrant, the thyrses terminal and auxilary, forming large leafy penioles 10-18 cm long.

Fruit a thick, dehiscent capsule, narrowly oblong deeply 3 three locules each containing one seed; sulcate, somewhat verucose, acutely angulate, about 4.5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide, yellowish-brown.

Seed laterally compressed, brown, winged and wind-dispersed. The size varies but is typically about 4.5 cm long, wing included. The embryo is large (1.8-2.4 cm long) and there is no endosperm.
Ecology

It inhabits the humid tropical forest and the very humid forest of the coastal plains, where it often grows in monospecific stands or in patches with other Vochysia spp. It is also associated with Calophyllum brasiliense, Simphonia globulifera, Terminalia amazonia, Ferrule koschnyi, Dialium guianensis, Guarea grandifolia, among others.
Native range
Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama
Tree management

Planting should not be delayed as the roots grow fast. If the bag is not deep enough, the roots are damaged, affecting seedling growth.

For monospecific plantations a planting distance of 4 x 4 m is recommended. The distance should not be less than this as the tree tops close very quickly. The species has a type of autopruning but it is convenient to prune the saplings 9-12 months after planting to eliminate ramifications.
Seed collection normally begins two months after flowering and before the fruits begin to open. The fruits are collected from the trees when they change from light to dark green and lines of division between locules become marked. Seeds should never be collected from the ground as they are quickly infected by fungi.

On average, a mature tree can be expected to produce one kg of seed. The seeds do not mature at the same time and it may be necessary to collect several times from a seed source during the season. After collection the seeds are transported in jute sacks to the processing site, where they are dried in the shade for 2-3 days or until the capsules open. Fresh seeds have a moisture content of 45-55%. Sun drying of either fruits or seeds should be avoided as it may affect viability.

The seeds storage behavior is orthodox. There are 3500-4800 fresh seeds and 7000-8000 dry seeds/kg.
It inhabits the humid tropical forest and the very humid forest of the coastal plains, where it often grows in monospecific stands or in patches with other Vochysia spp. It is also associated with Calophyllum brasiliense, Simphonia globulifera, Terminalia amazonia, Ferrule koschnyi, Dialium guianensis, Guarea grandifolia, among others.
The seeds are sown in boxes with fine sand. Unlike most other seeds, the radicle does not emerge through the micropyle but laterally through the seed coat. The best result is obtained when the seeds are placed horizontally in the soil allowing correct root anchoring and faster growth (see illustration below). Alternatively the seeds can be sown vertically with the wing buried in the soil. Germination starts 10-12 days after sowing and is complete within one month. Fresh seeds normally exhibit a nearly 100% germination rate.

The seedlings must be transferred to bags some 10 days after germination and before the first pair of leaves appears. After transplanting the seedlings must be protected from direct sunlight for the first couple of weeks. Tranplanting is done after 4-6 months, when the plants are about 30 cm tall.
Timber: The wood is light but strong, with a density of 0.35-0.45 g/cubic cm. It is suitable for carpentry, posts, building poles, interior construction, boxes, tool handles, toys, furniture, canoes and veneer. The fibre quality is similar to that of Gmelina arborea and has potential use in production of paper pulp.
Lipids: The embryo has high concentrations of lipids (28.6%) and proteins (34%) but is low in carbohydrates (4.2%)."
Vangueria infausta,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (wildemispel,grootmispel), English (wild medlar), Swahili (viru,mviru,muiru,mtiegu), Zulu (umViyo)
Vangueria infausta is a deciduous tree 3-8 m in height with a short trunk and hanging branchlets. Bark pale grey-brown, peeling in untidy flakes; branches usually opposite with reddish tomentose young branchlets.

Leaves dull green, opposite, rusty tomentose, medium to large, 5-24 x 3.8-15 cm, shape varying from ovate or obovate to lanceolate or rounded; net-veining, conspicuous below. Leaf apices either obtuse or sub-acuminate; base tapering; margin entire; petiole 3-10 mm long. Leaf stalks short, 5-10 mm long; stipules long, between young leaves.

Flowers about 4 mm long and 6 mm in diameter, hairy, profusely borne on opposite and axillary cymes; petals yellow-green, the corolla falling early to leave 5 triangular sepals less than 2 mm long on the young green fruit; buds pointed.

Fruit subglobose, glossy, 3-6.5 x 3.5-6 cm, greenish when unripe, turning brownish after ripening and with a soft fleshy pulp. The fruit bears a characteristic star-shaped scar from the remains of the calyx. It contains 3-5 hard-coated seeds, 2-3 cm long, 1-5 cm wide.

The generic name ‘Vangueria’ is derived from a Malagasy word, and ‘infausta’ means unlucky; making fire with the wood is taboo.
Ecology

V. infausta is found in all types of woodland, especially on rocky ridges and hillsides or in wooded grassland; also near the sea on sand dunes. It can withstand long periods of drought and frost. Widely distributed in savannah-like communities derived from forest (including forest remnants), and often in rocky or sandy places.
Native range
Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Young plants transplant well but must receive regular watering for the 1st 5 weeks after transplanting. They are light demanding, and the growth rate is usually slow; 40-50 cm/year. Groups of V. infausta can be planted scattered in fields, near water points and along homestead fences. The flowers attract insects, which in turn attract insect-eating birds.
Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; seed can retain viability for up to 1 year in storage if dried properly. There are about 500 seeds/kg.

Widely distributed in savannah-like communities derived from forest (including forest remnants), and often in rocky or sandy places.
The species regenerates naturally by suckers, coppice and, rarely, by seed. Soak seeds overnight and plant the following morning in seedling trays filled with river sand and cover with a thin layer of sand. Germination rate is good (usually 80% or more), and cracking the hard seed coat may increase the rate, but germination takes a long time. Transfer seedlings to nursery bags when they reach the 3-leaf stage and keep them for at least 1 year before planting them into the field. Cuttings can be made from the present year’s growth, but they must be treated with a root-stimulating hormone powder. Plant them during early spring in river sand.
 The fruits are eaten raw and the pulp sometimes soaked in water and then dried to use later. The pulp, when mixed with a little sugar and water, makes a good substitute for applesauce; it has a sweet and slightly sour taste. Each 100 g fresh fruit contain 3.7 g vitamin C, 1.4 g protein, 28 g carbohydrate, 28 mg sodium, 0.61 mg nicotinic acid and high levels of calcium and magnesium. Seeds can be eaten roasted.
Fodder: The leaves of V. infausta are seldom browsed by cattle, but very much so by goats, and the leaves and young branches are eaten by elephant, giraffe, kudu and nyala. Red-footed squirrels, bushbabies, vervet monkeys and baboons eat the fruit on the tree, and bushpig eat it on the ground.
V. infausta is a good source of firewood.
Timber: Poles for houses, agricultural implements and handles are some of the ways in which the wood is utilized.
Medicine: Traditional healers use the roots for a variety of illnesses such as malaria and pneumonia. An infusion made from the roots is used to treat coughs and other chest troubles. A decoction from the root is used as a purgative and an anthelmintic (especially for Ascaris), and is also a popular snakebite remedy. The pounded leaves are applied to tick-bite sores on livestock and dogs to speed up healing. A poultice made of the leaves is used to treat swellings on the legs and inflammation of the navel in children. An infusion of the leaves is used in treating abdominal pain and for the relief of dental pain. In southern Africa, a decoction is used as a remedy for menstrual troubles.
Alcohol: In South Africa, farmers distil ‘mampoer’ from the ripe fruit."
Vangueria madagascariensis,"Local names:
 Bislama (sinara), English (common wild medlar), Swahili (mviru,muiru), Tigrigna (harnkeren)
Vangueria madagascariensis is a profusely branched shrub or small tree, 2-15 m tall, with smooth grey bark and a whitish or cream slash.

Leaves opposite, elliptic-ovate or rotundate, dark green above, paler beneath, glabrous or, rarely, slightly pubescent, with acuminate or, rarely, obtuse or acute apex and prominent venation below, 7-20 x 2-11 cm. Leaf stalks 5-10 mm long. 

Flowers greenish-yellow, yellow or cream, fulvous-pubescent, borne in dense axillary cymes, sweet scented.

Fruit globose, very smooth and shiny, 3-4.5 x 2.5-4.2 cm, greenish when immature, changing to yellowish-brown when ripe, contain 4-5 woody seeds up to 1.6 cm long.

The generic name ‘Vangueria’ is derived from a Malagasy word.
Ecology

V. madagascariensis is commonly found in evergreen forest, riverine forest, wooded bushland and wooded grassland throughout Africa and into Asia and Australia. It grows naturally in riverine-lowland forests and Brachystegia-Combretum woodland. The species is fire sensitive.
Native range
Angola, Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Coppicing and pollarding are suitable management practices. The crop is mostly semi-cultivated on farms. Because it is a light demander, the planting area should be cleared of most other vegetation. Weeding the crop until it is well established is essential.
Can retain viability for a year if dried properly. There are 500-600 seeds/kg.

V. madagascariensis regenerates naturally from coppice and seed. Seed germination is difficult owing to the hard seed coat. The ripe fruit is persistent and needs to be picked directly from the tree. Unripe fruit can also be picked and stored for several days before ripening. Seeds germinate well but sporadically (taking up to 6 weeks); nicking the seed or soaking it in cold water overnight may hasten germination.
 The ripe fruit pulp is edible and has a pleasant chocolate-like flavour. The fruit is also used to add flavour to beer.
Apiculture: The pleasant-smelling flowers of V. madagascariensis attract bees, and are therefore a suitable honey source. 
This multibranched shrub or tree is popular as a source of both firewood and charcoal.
Timber: Wood is suitable for building construction, tool handles and carving. 
Medicine: Roots and bark are used in traditional medicine; for example, in Tanzania an extract from the roots is used to treat worm infections."
Vernonia amygdalina,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (rivierbloutee), Amharic (grawa), English (vernonia tree,bitter leaf), Luganda (mululuza,muburizi), Tigrigna (grawa)
Vernonia amygdalina is a bushy shrub or well-formed tree up to 7 m in height. Bark light grey or brown, rather rough and longitudinally flaking; branches brittle.

Leaves lanceolate to oblong; up to 28 x 10 cm, but usually about 10-15 x 4-5 cm. Leathery, medium to dark green, with or without sparse hairs above, with fine, soft, pale hairs below and conspicuous net-veining; apex and base tapering, base always almost symmetric, margin entire or very finely toothed; petiole usually very short but may be 1-2 cm long.

Flower heads thistlelike, small, creamy-white, sometimes slightly touched with mauve, about 10 mm long, grouped in dense heads, axillary and terminal, forming large flat clusters about 15 cm in diameter but not conspicuous; sweetly scented, especially in the evening.

Fruit a small nutlet, with minute glands and bristly hairs on the body and a long tuft of bristly hairs at the top.

The genus was named in honour of an English botanist, William Vernon, traveller and plant collector in North America in the 17th century. The specific name means ‘like an almond’—the allusion is not clear.

Apiculture: Produces very light, fine flavoured honey.
Both firewood and charcoal are derived form V. amygdalina.
Timber: The genus Vernonia is a well-known group of timber trees.
Medicine: An infusion from the roots is given to children suffering from infection by a trematode (Enterobius vermicularis). A cold infusion of the root bark, together with other plants, is given in daily doses to treat bilharzia. The bark and root are taken as a tonic by people suffering from fevers; leaves are also pounded, the juice extracted and drunk for fever. The leaves are pounded and mixed with warm water for bathing to treat spots on the skin and nausea.
Ornamental: Useful as an ornamental.
The termite-resistant branches are useful as stakes for lining out plantations and as a live fence.
Other services: A drought and termite resistant tree."
Vitellaria paradoxa,"Local names:
 Arabic (lulu), English (sheanut tree,shea-butter tree,shea tree,bambouk butter tree,galam butter tree), French (karité,arbre a beurre,beurre de galam,beurre/graisse de karité), Fula (balire,kareje), German (Schibutterßaum,Sheabutterßaum), Hausa (man ka’d
Vitellaria paradoxa is a small to medium-sized tree (min. 7) 10-15 (max. 25) m high; much branched, dense, spreading, round to hemispherical crown. In mature trees the bole is short, usually 3-4 m but exceptionally 8 m, with a diameter ranging from 0.3 to 1 m, but most frequently 0.6 m. Bark conspicuously thick, corky, horizontally and longitudinally deeply fissured; protects older trees against bush fires. Slash pale pink, secreting white latex, as do broken twigs or petioles.

Leaves in dense clusters, spirally arranged at the end of stout twigs. They are covered by thick bark showing numerous leaf scars. Petioles 5-15 cm long, leaves oblong. Juvenile leaves rust-red and pubescent, later coriaceous, glabrous and dark green, shining, 12-25 cm long and 4-7 cm wide, leaf margin wavy and bent.

The flowers develop in the axils of scale leaves, at the extremities of dormant twigs, from buds formed 2 years previously. Inflorescence a dense fascicle 5-7.5 cm in diameter, at the end of a flowering twig, each usually containing 30-40 flowers, though 80-100 have been recorded. Individual flowers white or creamy-white, about 1.5 cm in diameter and subtended by scarious, brown, ovate or lanceolate bracteoles, which are abscised before flower opening.

Fruit 5-8 cm long and 3-4 cm wide, elliptic, a yellow-green or yellow berry with thick butter-like, mucous pericarp; generally containing only 1 oval or round red-brown seed (the shea nut), surrounded by a fragile shining shell with a large, round, rough hilum on a broad base.

The genus Vitellaria is considered by botanical authorities as monospecific, two subspecies are recognized ssp. paradoxa restricted to Western Africa and ssp. nilotica of Eastern Africa.
Ecology

The shea tree is a light-demanding species of open sites and parkland savannah; forming extensive pure stands in some areas but often also associated with other trees, such as Parkia biglobosa (nere). Avoids swampy areas, those liable to flooding for any length of time, moist heavy loam soils or watercourses. The extensive root system is essential for survival in the 5-7-month dry seasons of savannah climates. Can withstand quite severe fires.
Native range
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Togo, Uganda
Tree management

Wide spacing, site preparation and elimination of weed competition, as well as protection against fire and browsing, are essential. The tree grows relatively slowly at first; growth rates can be accelerated by adding compost and fertilizer. In the Sahel, successful cultivation can be attempted only on sites with a good water supply, for example, along seasonal watercourses. The 1st fruits are borne 3-4 years after flowering, and trees do not start to bear fruit until they are 15-20 years old.

Because of its value as a source of oil, Vitellaria has long been an integral component of wooded farmland agriculture. Often, it is the only tree to be spared when woodland is cleared for cultivation. These preserved specimens may be as much as 150-200 years old.
The seeds of Vitellaria are recalcitrant; viability falls rapidly a week after removal from the fruit and is lost completely within 3-6 weeks. Ripe fruit that falls directly to the ground germinates easily if the soil is moist, but many seedlings succumb to drought and bush fires. Germination is cryptogeal; that is, the shoots arise from belowground even though the seed germinate on the surface.

Avoids swampy areas, those liable to flooding for any length of time, moist heavy loam soils or watercourses. The extensive root system is essential for survival in the 5-7-month dry seasons of savannah climates. Can withstand quite severe fires.
Fresh seeds germinate well. Growing directly in situ is sometimes recommended because of the long taproot and transplanting difficulties. Seedlings raised in pots should be out-planted after 14-24 weeks, plants raised in seedbeds after 12 months as balled planting stock. Air-layering is possible but difficult. Grafting methods have been developed and show a 25% success rate, provided the grafts are not water stressed and that latex does not block the graft-stock union.
Wax: The high melting point of the fat renders it especially suitable for candle manufacture.
Poison: Waste water from traditional shea-butter extraction is believed to keep white ants away. Traditionally, shea butter, at a rate of 5 ml oil/kg of seed, has been shown to protect Vigna subterranea against Callosobruchus maculatus. A root-bark extract (100 ppm) is effective against Bulinus globosus; when mixed with tobacco, the roots are used as a poison by the Jukun of northern Nigeria. Infusions of the bark have selective antimicrobial properties, being effective against Sarcina lutea and Staphyllococus aureus.
Erosion control: It regenerates well, and is traditionally favoured and protected by farmers. As a result, it has played a significant role in soil and water conservation and environmental protection in semi-arid West Africa.
 Shea butter extracted from the nuts is one of the most affordable and widely used vegetable fats in the Sahel. Today, shea nuts are important internationally and are sold to European and Japanese food industries. The refined fat is sold as baking fat, margarine and other fatty spreads under various trade names and finds increasing use in various foodstuffs. Shea butter has a fatty composition similar to that of cocoa butter, so is often used as a substitute for cocoa, and in pastry because it makes a highly pliable dough. Traditionally prepared unpurified, shea butter is sold in ‘loaves’ in markets and, if properly prepared and wrapped in leaves, is resistant to oxidative rancidity and will keep for years if not exposed to air and heat. Nuts that have been cleaned and lightly sun dried without previous maceration yield a tasteless, odourless fat. Traditionally prepared shea butter, after refining, is also tasteless and odourless. The edible fruit pulp constitutes 50-80% of the whole fruit. It is allowed to become slightly overripe before being eaten raw; it can also be eaten lightly cooked. Children eat the nuts raw, while the flowers are made into fritters by some ethnic groups. Caterpillars of Cirina butyrospermii A. Vuilet, which feed exclusively on the leaves of the shea-butter tree, are dried and sold in markets in Nigeria and Senegal. They are rich in protein and sometimes eaten in a sauce.
Fodder: Shea-nut cake is increasingly used for livestock and poultry feed. Leaves and young sprouts serve as forage. Sheep and pigs eat the sugary pulp of ripe fruit that have fallen to the ground.
Apiculture: The tree is much sought after for placing hives in traditional apiculture. Vitellaria furnishes the bees with a great quantity of nectar and pollen.
Excellent-quality firewood that burns with a fierce heat. The charcoal is not good quality, however; it burns rapidly and is friable and, although it provides enough heat for domestic use, is not suitable for iron-working. The sticky black residue from fat extraction can also be used as a substitute for kerosene when lighting firewood. Due to its value as a fruit tree, V. paradoxa is seldom cut for fuel.
Timber: Wood brownish-red, darkens readily on exposure; strong, hard, heavy, durable, resilient, and weathers and wears well. Despite its hardness, it saws and planes well, takes an excellent polish, and glues, nails and screws well, but preboring is advisable to prevent splitting. Wood is used in engineering structures, house posts and support poles, also in ship building, for shingles, stakes and fencing, sleepers, medium and heavy-duty flooring, joinery, seats, household utensils, durable platters and bowls, pestles and mortars and tool handles. It is termite resistant.
Tannin or dyestuff: Ashes from burnt wood are commonly used as the dye.
Lipids: The shea-butter tree is an important oil-producing plant, especially as it occurs where other such plants are rare. It is also useful in soap making, but it is unique in having a high fraction of oil (8%) that does not convert into soap; this fraction has numerous medicinal qualities. The sticky black residue that remains after the clarification of butter is used for filling cracks in hut walls.
Medicine: Shea butter protects against sunburn, so is a useful ingredient in sun-protection or post-sun-exposure products. It also encourages wound healing and soothes skin irritation. Shea butter is stable and permits the fast release of medicaments; it can therefore be used as a base for suppositories and ointments. Shea butter is traditionally used in medicines, particularly for the preparation of skin ointments, and is used to treat inflammation, rashes in children, dermatitis, sunburn, chapping, irritation, ulcers and as a rub for rheumatism. Leaf decoctions are used for stomach-ache, headache and as an eye lotion. Roots and root bark are ground to a paste and taken orally to cure jaundice, or are boiled and pounded to treat chronic sores and girth sores in horses. They are also used for the treatment of diarrhoea and stomach-ache. A bark decoction is used in a bath to facilitate childbirth in Cote d’Ivoire; it is drunk to encourage lactation after delivery, although in northern Nigeria such a concoction is said to be lethal. A bark infusion is used as an eyewash as a footbath to help extract jiggers, and to neutralize the venom of the spitting cobra. Infusions have been taken for the treatment of leprosy in Guinea-Bissau and for gastric problems as well as for diarrhoea and dysentery. Macerated with the bark of Ceiba pentandra and salt, infusions have been used to treat cattle with worms in Senegal and Guinea. Tapinanthus globifera, one of the most common parasitic plants on Vitellaria, also has many medicinal uses.
Soil improver: The husks of the seeds make a good mulch and fertilizer.
Intercropping: V. paradoxa can be combined well with many cereal crops.
Latex or rubber: The latex is heated and mixed with palm oil to make a glue. Latex obtained from the bark of the trees could be used as a chewing-gum base, but it does not have a very pleasant taste. Washing improves the taste but detracts from the chewin
Pollution control: Studies on the byproducts of shea-butter processing have shown that heavy-metal ions can be removed from aqueous solutions, for example waste water, using Vitellaria seed husks."

Warburgia salutaris,"Local names:
 Afrikaans (peperbasboom), English (pepperbark tree,East African greenheart), Swahili (msokonoi), Trade name (isiBhaha), Zulu (isiBaha)
Warburgia salutaris is an aromatic evergreen tree, usually 5-10 m in height, but reaching 20 m in some areas, with a dense erect canopy. Bark smooth and grey on young branches but brown and slightly rough with prominent yellowish corky lenticels on older branches and stems; inner bark reddish, with a peppery smell.

Leaves aromatic, alternate, simple, elliptic to lanceolate, 4.5-11 x 1-3 cm, glossy dark green above, paler green and dull below; midrib frequently slightly off-centre; apex and base tapering; margin entire; petiole 1-3 mm long. 

Flowers bisexual, up to 7 mm in diameter, solitary or in 3-flowered cymes in axils of leaves, green, 3 sepals, 10 petals, 5 inner petals smaller, thinner in texture and yellower than outer 5, filaments fused to form a prominent staminal tube. 

Fruit oval berries, 4 cm in diameter, turning dark purple when ripe; skin leathery, glandular, black when mature. Containing 2 or more seeds with oily endosperm.

The genus is named after Dr Otto Warburg (1859-1938), born in Hamburg, a lecturer in botany at the University of Berlin and author of numerous botanical papers. The specific name ‘salutaris’ means ‘healthy’ or ‘salutary’, presumably in reference to its medicinal properties.
Ecology

Habitat ranges from evergreen montane forest to evergreen sandveld forest along the coast; also found in secondary bushland, wooded ravines and in grasslands. It is moderately drought resistant and not suitable for areas that experience frost.
Native range
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
Tree management

The tree has coppicing abilities. Care and good time management must be taken during bark removal to avoid tree mortality. The tree can be planted along fence lines, in scattered groups or, preferably, in a small plantation. Although fairly slow growing, in warm, frost-free areas growth can be as much as 90 cm/year.
W. salutaris is classified as recalcitrant; however, with dry seed viability can be maintained for 6 months at cool temperatures; storability is intermediate between orthodox and recalcitrant. Seed can be stored for a short time in moist sawdust at 3 deg. C. More investigation is needed. There are approximately 10 500 seeds/kg.
Habitat ranges from evergreen montane forest to evergreen sandveld forest along the coast; also found in secondary bushland, wooded ravines and in grasslands. It is moderately drought resistant and not suitable for areas that experience frost.
W. salutaris can be grown from seed, but the seeds are invariably infested with insects. Wash the fruit first and sow fresh seed promptly; germination rates are good (over 80% in about 15 days). An easier and more successful method is to grow the plant from root suckers or, better still, from stem and tip cuttings. When sufficient roots are formed, transfer the plants into nursery bags filled with a mixture of river sand and compost (3:1) and keep them for a year before planting out. The tree also has been successfully propagated using wildings.
 Fresh or dried leaves can be used in various dishes or tea to add an agreeable aroma and, peppery taste.
Fodder: Leaves, pods and seeds all provide good fodder.
Wood is used as firewood and charcoal.
Timber: Sapwood light yellow, heartwood dark yellowish-brown, oily, aromatic and darkening with exposure to air. The wood is used as a timber for furniture and tools. It saws and planes well but it is not durable.
Shade or shelter: The dense leaf canopy provides good shade.
Tannin or dyestuff: Tannins are found in the bark.
Medicine: The inner bark is used as a treatment for malaria, colds, chest complaints, coughs, diarrhoea, muscle pains, stomach-ache and general body pains. Dried and ground to a snuff, it is used to clear the sinuses; smoke from the burning bark is inhaled as a remedy for chest complaints. The stem and root bark act as an expectorant; the leaves are used as part of an infusion to treat rheumatism.
Gum or resin: Resin is extracted from this tree; the peppery taste is due to the amorphous resinous substances.
Ornamental: An evergreen tree with white flowers, W. salutaris is widely planted as an ornamental. When used as greenery in flower arrangements, small branches last up to 3 weeks in water. It is also very successful when grown as a pot plant; if kept in light shade the plant takes on a neat shape and the leaves become very glossy. 
It can be grown either as single trees around boundaries or to make an attractive dense hedge.
Soil improver: Foliage can be used for green manure and mulch.
Intercropping: W. salutaris can be intercropped for shade in coffee, banana and cocoa plantations."

Ecology

W. ugandensis occurs in lowland rainforest, upland dry evergreen forest and its relicts in secondary bushland and grassland; also on termitaria in swamp forest.
Native range
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda
Tree management

Deserves wide planting as a shapely garden or park tree, but young plants can be difficult to obtain. The bark is frequently removed for medicinal use, and care must be taken to avoid tree mortality. A fairly slow-growing tree, but once established it is hardy and coppicing can be practised.
W. ugandensis is classified as recalcitrant; however, with dry seed, viability can be maintained for 6 months at cool temperatures, storability is intermediate between orthodox and recalcitrant. In the short term, seeds can be stored in moist sawdust at 3 deg. C. Based on fruit structure, seed size and natural habitats, seed of this species may not be recalcitrant. More investigation is needed. A purity of 98% can be achieved. On average, there are 10 000 seed/kg, depending on the provenance and the climatic conditions of the ripening year.
W. ugandensis occurs in lowland rainforest, upland dry evergreen forest and its relicts in secondary bushland and grassland; also on termitaria in swamp forest.
Natural regeneration is primarily from seed, which germinates easily in natural forests. Artificially, W. ugandensis can be regenerated from cuttings, seedlings and direct sowing. Timing of the seed collection is important. Fruit that has fallen to the ground rots easily. The ripe fruit is collected directly from the tree or shaken off the branches and collected from the ground. Pretreatment is not necessary. Under ideal conditions, the seeds germinate within 15 days. The average germination rate of mature, healthy and freshly sown seed is 70%.
Poison: The heartwood contains new sesquiterpenoids such as bemadienolide, cinnamide, drimenol, muzigadial, polygodial, warburganal, warburgiadione, warburgin, ugandensidial and ugandensolide. These compounds exhibit anti-feedant activity against armyworm (Spodoptera littoralis and S. exepta), widely occurring African crop pests. The anti-feedant activities of warburganal and muzigadial are comparable. These two compounds belong to the strongest group of anti-feedants against African armyworm found so far. In addition, they exhibit very potent antifungal, antiyeast and plant-growth regulating activity.
 Fruit edible; all parts have a hot peppery taste. The leaves and seeds are sometimes used to add flavour to curries.
Fodder: Leaves, pods and seeds are fed to livestock.
The wood has a high oil content and burns well with an incense-like smell.
Timber: Heartwood yellow or greenish, becoming brown on exposure; very fragrant when freshly cut, the scent somewhat resembling that of sandalwood. Good timber for building and furniture, but not termite resistant. It saws easily, planes well and takes a high polish, but it is not durable and is liable to split on nailing. The wood somewhat resembles teak and shows a satin lustre; its fragrance persists over 4 years of storage. Milling of the wood gives rise to a dust that is very fragrant and causes sneezing.
Shade or shelter: The crown provides shade.
Medicine: Dried bark is commonly chewed and the juice swallowed as a remedy for stomach-ache, constipation, toothache, cough, fever, muscle pains, weak joints and general body pains. It is also effective in powdered form for treating the same diseases. Fresh roots are boiled and mixed with soup for the prevention of diarrhoea. Leaf decoction baths are used as a cure for several skin diseases. The inner bark is reddish, bitter and peppery and has a variety of applications. It provides treatment for the common cold; dried and ground to a snuff it is used to clear sinuses; and it is chewed, or smoke from the burning bark inhaled, as a remedy for chest complaints. The bark, roots or leaves can be boiled in water and the decoction drunk to treat malaria, but this causes violent vomiting.
Gum or resin: The resin is used locally as glue to fix tool handles.
Ornamental: W. ugandensis is often planted for amenity purposes.
Soil improver: Can provide green manure and mulch."

A mostly solitary tree dispersed in open country, savannah, gallery forest, along coastal areas, in the understorey of dry forests, in dry woodlands, or on riverbanks. X. americana is drought resistant.
Seed and cuttings. The tree regenerates naturally from seed and coppice. Fresh seed should be sown for good germination.
Poison: Sambunigrine has been identified as the main cyanogenetic principle in the plant. Leaves at 100 ppm cause 100% mortality of Bulinus globus, the vector in the transmission of schistosomiasis. Bark and crushed fruit rind are applied to sores on domestic animals and to keep off fleas.
 The fruits, as well as being pleasant to eat raw, can be used to make juice, jams and jellies, or an intoxicating drink. The pulp of seed and fruit contains hydrocyanic acid, and it is advisable not to chew the seed. Kernel oil is used as a vegetable butter and as a ghee substitute. Young leaves are edible after thorough cooking.
Firewood and charcoal are the chief uses of the wood, because the trunk is usually too small to make it useful for timber.
Tannin or dyestuff: Bark is used for tanning; it contains approximately 17% tannin, which gives leather a reddish colour. Roots also used in tanning. Bark is used to strengthen indigo dyes.
Lipids: The fruit yields up to 67.4% oil from the seed that has been used as a body and hair oil. The oil is not edible, and the presence of a rubberlike substance excludes it from many industrial uses.
Medicine: Leaves and twigs are used for fevers, colds, as a mouthwash for toothache, as a laxative and an eye lotion. Leaves are used for headaches, angina, and as a poison antidote. Roots treat skin problems, headaches, leprosy, haemorrhoids, sexually transmitted diseases, guinea worm, sleeping sickness, oedema, and act as an antidote to poison. The fruit is useful in treating habitual constipation. The bark is used in decoction, dried or powdered as a cicatrisant and applied to skin ulcers; it is put on the head for febrile headache, placed in bath water for sick children, and used for kidney and heart complaints. The fruit eaten in large quantities acts as a vermifuge. A decoction of the roots or fruits is used to treat dysentery in calves.
Ornamental: X. americana has attractive foliage and flowers.
Suited to cultivation as a hedge plant.
Alcohol: In South Africa, the fruits have been used to make a kind of beer.
Essential oil: Heartwood contains an essential oil used for fumigation. The flowers have an essential oil that could be a good substitute for orange blossom."

The common associate tree species are Acacia tortilis, Afzelia quanzensis, Brachystegia spiciformis, Grewia bicolor, Maytenus senegalensis, Terminalia sericea, among others.
Naturally, regeneration of X. caffra is by seed, coppice, and root suckers. Artificial propagation can be through seeding although no efforts to regenerate this species have been made. It is possible that seeds need no treatment. Coppice shoots are produced on felling the trees. Root suckers too are produced after wounding the roots.
 The fruits are eaten raw, though bitter or sour, but refreshing and has an almond-like scent. Alternatively the fruits are put into cold water and the skin and kernel are removed by pressing them out and the resulting porridge is mixed with pounded tubers, which is then eaten. The fruits are also suitable for preparing jam.
It is used as firewood.
Timber: Wood is hard and fine-grained. It is used to make tool handles, spoons and in general construction. 
 Oil: The roasted seeds are mashed in the mortar yielding a viscous, non-drying oil is applied to colour the hair to dark black and helps to straighten it. Oil from the seeds (Ximenia oil) is also used to soften leather, bowstrings, cosmetic products locally and for a general body ointment.
Medical use: The roots are used to treat abscess, severe stomachaches or colic, and against malaria, cough and bilharzia. The tree is also used as a remedy for syphilis, hookworm, chest pains and generalized body pain. The roots are pounded and boiled with maize flour for porridge, which is eaten to prevent sterility in women. The roasted and pounded seeds are used for wounds
Ornamental: X. caffra is used as ornamental and live fence"

Seeds black, 5-8 per pod, kidney-shaped seeds of approximately 10 mm length with a yellow papery aril. The hull is aromatic, but not the seed itself.

Xylopia is Greek (‘xylon pikron’) for ‘bitter wood’, while aethiopica refers its Ethiopian origin.
Ecology

Xylopia is native to the lowland rainforest and moist fringe forest in the savanna zones of Africa, but largely found in West, Central and Southern Africa. These trees are widely distributed in the humid forest zones especially along rivers in the drier area of the region.
Native range
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda
Tree management

The plant grows rapidly during the first three years. Trees are planted eight meters apart. In Ghana, it has been successfully intercropped with other staple food items in the first four years.
In West Africa, harvesting time runs from February to May and again from August to October. The fruits are harvested with the inflorescence. After picking, the fruits are sun-dried for 4-7 days. After drying, the fruits are removed from the inflorescence stalks. Fruits should not be dried on the ground, but on a protective cloth, net, screen or shelving system to minimize any microbial contamination. Typical fruit yields are about two to three metric tons per annum per hectare. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox.
Xylopia is native to the lowland rainforest and moist fringe forest in the savanna zones of Africa, but largely found in West, Central and Southern Africa. These trees are widely distributed in the humid forest zones especially along rivers in the drier area of the region.
Propagation is usually by seeds. Seedlings are transplanted to the field within 3-5 months after sowing.
 Crushed powdered fruits and seeds are dried and used as pepper substitute. The seeds have an aromatic, pungent taste and were formerly sold under the name: Ethiopian pepper, Guinea pepper and Negro pepper. The dried fruits are important as flavorings to prepare local soups in West Africa.
A good source of firewood
Timber: The wood is used as a general purpose timber in tool handles, beds, oxen yokes, knife sheaths and spear handles. 
Shade or shelter: The tree provides a good shade.
Medicine: Medicinally, the fruit is used against cough, stomachache, dizziness, amenorrhoea, bronchitis (when smoked and inhaled), dysentery, enema, bulimia (eating disorder), lumbago and neuralgia. It is also used a calmative, purgative, repulsive to pain, and in the treatment of boils and skin eruptions. The odiforous roots of the plant are employed in tinctures, administered orally to expel worms and other parasitic animals from the intestines, or in teeth rinsing and mouth wash extracts against toothaches. The fruits mixed with its roots are used in the treatment of rheumatism. 
Ornamental: Sometimes used as ornamental species.
Intercropping: The plant is successfully intercropped with other staple food items in the first four years.
Essential oil: The essential oil yield varies from 2-4.5%. The bark oil consists mainly of pinene, trans-pinocarveol, verbenone and myrtenol whereas the leaf oil is mainly spathulenol, cryptone, beta-caryophyllene and limonene."

Ecology

Z. gilletii is a tropical rainforest species, distributed between altitude range 900-2 400 m. It sometimes is a component of the Aningeria-Strombosia-Drypetes forest in montane rainforest at altitudes between 1 600 and 2 100 m, these forests are characterised by a distinct dry season not exceeding 2-3 months.
Native range
Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe
Tree management

Seeds are collected from the mature reddish-brown capsules which would otherwise open and disperse seed. The extraction is after a fruit drying process for 2 days, extracted seed should not be exposed to direct sunlight. In mountain rain forests the species grows less robustly than in tropical rainforest.
Seeds are recalcitrant. So far no successful treatment has been developed for the species, because of its unclear dormancy, generally it is assumed the oily seed coat plays a role in the seed’s quiescence. Extracted seeds should not be exposed too much to sunlight. There are about 45 000 seeds/kg, the amount varies depending on provenance and climatic conditions of the ripening year. Seed is susceptible to insect attack, addition of ash reduces loss from this source.

Zelkova serrata,"Local names:
 Chinese (orinoco Jute,Japanese ju shu), English (water-elm,sawtooth zelkova,saw-leaf zelkova,Japanese zelkova,gray-bark elm), Japanese (kiaki)
Zelkova serrata is a deciduous tree, vase shaped when young, rounded umbrella-like habit when mature (roughly the same shape as Ulmus americana), main branching starts low creating a short trunk, grows to 15.2-18.3 m in height and rarely reaches 30.5 m. Older trees grown in the open can have a very wide and majestic canopy.  

Leaves alternate, dark green above and much paler below, simple, oblong-ovate, 2.5-5 cm long but can be up to 12.7 cm long on some fast growing shoots with acuminate tips, pinnately veined and serrate leaf margin. Leaves are dark green above and much paler below.  The foliage puts on a showy display in fall when the leaves turn yellow then orange or red before dropping.

Flower monoecious; yellow-green, not showy, occur in tight clusters along new stems; appearing before the leaves. 

Fruit a small triangular drupe, pea green turning brown, sub-sessile, 2.5 cm long and 2.5-3.5 mm in diameter with the surface covered by an irregular network of low ridges. 

Twig very slender, zigzag, red-brown with widely divergent, pointed, cone-shaped buds. 

Bark smooth and red-brown to gray when young with numerous lenticels; remains smooth for many years but eventually exfoliates into small patches exposing an orange to reddish brown inner bark.
Ecology

Zelkova serrata is found growing naturally in the lowlands (valleys, beside streams) and mountains of central and southern Japan in places with partial shade (light woodland) or no shade and moist well drained soil as a canopy tree.
Native range
Japan, Korea, Republic of, Taiwan, Province of China
Tree management

Zelkova serrata has a moderate to rapid growth rate.  Though established trees are fairly drought tolerant, the finest specimens are grown with regular watering.  For bonsai, the foliage should be sprayed with water daily during summer. 

It requires pruning to develop a strong structure since it is susceptible to breakage either at the crotch due to poor collar formation, or the wood itself tends to break.  This should be done in winter so that the tree looses less sap.  The foliage can also be developed by pinching back 2 sets of 4 new sets of leaves during the growing season.

To establish a wonderfully shaded street with a closed crown the trees should be planted on 30-foot-centers. 

To reduce leaf size, healthy trees can be leaf pruned in early summer. All of the leaves are removed, leaving only the leaf stems on the branches. The tree responds by putting out a second set of leaves, smaller than the first set.
Seeds show recalcitrant behaviour and should not be allowed to dry, or viability is rapidly lost.  Stored seed requires cold stratification and should be sown as early in the year as possible.
Zelkova serrata is found growing naturally in the lowlands (valleys, beside streams) and mountains of central and southern Japan in places with partial shade (light woodland) or no shade and moist well drained soil as a canopy tree.
Propagation is by seed, cuttings or bud-graftings 

Seeds should be sown outdoors in fall. They are best sown in a cold frame as soon as they are ripe, pricked out into individual pots and grown in a greenhouse for the first winter.  Planting out should be in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.

Greenwood cuttings taken in spring or summer from young plants can be made to take root. Root suckers can be transplanted. Named selections are usually grafted or budded onto seedling stock.
  Young leaves are cooked to make vegetables.
Timber:  Highly valued as a commercial timber tree in Japan, where its close-grained (beautiful) high quality wood is used to make fine furniture, tool handles, for construction etc.  The timber production of Z. serrata in Japan has basically depended on exploitation from natural populations.
Medicine:  The bark and leaves are used medicinally.
Ornamental: Zelkova is elm-like in shape and is often used as a replacement for American elm where the latter has died out due to Dutch elm disease. It is a handsome street tree or specimen for a park, large garden or around official facilities for shade or as a buffer strip. It is valued for its stately wide-spreading canopy, attractive bark characteristics and excellent fall color.  With its small leaves, pretty exfoliating gray and orange bark, and handsome fall color, Japanese zelkova is a popular bonsai tree."
Ziziphus abyssinica,"Local names:

Propagation is done using seedlings, and the seeds are sown in pots, or they can be sown directly at the planting site. Both prechilling and prolonged hot water treatments have been used to enhance germination. Seeds are pretreated by cracking the hard seed cover carefully or soaking in cold water for 24 hours before sowing. Growth regulators do not enhance germination of Z. abyssinica seeds.
  The sweet fruits are edible, and the leaves may be cooked as a vegetable.
Jujube is browsed by livestock in spite of its thorns, and in Democratic Republic of Congo, it is cultivated as a fodder crop.
Apiculture: Z. abyssinica is an excellent tree for bees, both pollen and nectar being easily available. 
The species is a source of firewood and is used in the production of charcoal.
Timber:  The dark brown to black wood is heavy, hard and resistant to termites and borers. It is used mainly as poles to fence kraals and villages and to cover graves. It is also used for furniture, interior work and carving.

Seed a tuberculate and irregularly furrowed stone, containing 1-2 elliptic brown kernels each 6 mm long.

The name ‘Ziziphus’ is often erroneously written as Zizyphus. The generic name is derived from the latinized version of the Arabic vernacular name ‘zizouf’ for Z. jujuba.
Ecology

Z.  mauritiana is a hardy tree that copes with extreme temperatures and thrives under rather dry conditions. Fruit quality is best under hot, sunny and dry conditions, but there should be a rainy season to support extension growth and flowering, ideally leaving enough residual soil moisture to carry the fruit to maturity. Commercial cultivation usually extends up to 1000 m. Beyond this elevation trees do not perform well, and cultivation becomes less economical.  Native to the tropical and subtropical regions, Z. mauritiana is more widespread in areas with an annual rainfall of 300-500 mm. It is known for its ability to withstand adverse conditions, such as salinity, drought and waterlogging.
Native range
Afghanistan, Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Uganda, Vietnam
Tree management

Z. mauritiana is a fast-growing species. Under favourable conditions, height increment on loose soil is 75 cm in 1 year and 1.2 m in 2 years; growth is stragglier by the 3rd season, when under similar growth conditions plants are thick and bushy, up to 1.5 m high. Growth is poor under natural conditions, 5-8 cm high after 1st season and 17-35 cm after 2nd season; Z. mauritiana coppices well and grows vigorously from stumps and root suckers. Fruiting starts after 3-5 years and is usually very abundant.
Orthodox storage behaviour, viability maintained for 2 years in hermetic air-dry storage at 5 deg. C. The germination rate increases during the 1st year of storage. The cleaned stones can be kept for 5 years in sealed containers, although during this period the viability drops from 95% to 30%. Z. mauritiana has 3300 pyrenes/kg.

It is known for its ability to withstand adverse conditions, such as salinity, drought and waterlogging.
Pretreatment is beneficial. Storage of the seed for 4 months to let it after-ripen improves germination. If facilities are available, stratification in sand for 60-90 days at 5 deg. C is recommended. Scarification, extracting the seed from the stone, and treating it with sulphuric acid has also been recommended. To germinate, seeds need full sunlight. Germination is epigeal and takes 3-4 weeks with seed left in stone, quicker if it is cracked, and 1 week if carefully extracted. Seed should be sown in trays or beds, and the seedlings pricked out when 2 pairs of true leaves have developed. The seedlings should also be given full light. It is likely that seedlings will need about 15 months in the nursery. Stumps may be used. When propagating selected varieties for fruit, budding or ring-grafting is used. Inarching and root-suckers are also possible methods of vegetative propagation.
Poison: Z. mauritiana is used to stupefy fish in Ethiopia.
Can withstand severe heat, frost and drought; hence it is planted in dry areas and on sites unfit for other crops.
Erosion control:  A suitable species to aid in fixation of coastal dune sand.
 Fruit is eaten fresh or dried and can be made into a floury meal, butter, or a cheeselike paste, used as a condiment. Also used for candy making and pickling. The fruit is a good source of carotene, vitamins A and C, and fatty oils. A refreshing drink is prepared by macerating fruits in water. In Indonesia, young leaves are cooked as a vegetable.
In parts of India and North Africa, the leaves of Z. mauritiana are used as nutritious fodder for sheep and goats. Analysis of the chemicals constituents on a dry weight basis indicates the leaves contain 15.4% crude protein, 15.8% crude fibre, 6.7% total minerals, and 16.8% starch. In India, the leaves are also gathered to feed tasar silkworms; tasar silk, highly prized, is the only silk commercially exploited in the tropics.
Apiculture: When in bloom it is ocassionally a source of pollen, at best a minor one.
Z. mauritiana produces excellent firewood (sapwood has 4900 kcals/kg) and good charcoal. Its drooping branches are easily accessible for harvesting.
Timber: Z. mauritiana yields a medium-weight to heavy hardwood with a density of 535-1080 kg/m³. Heartwood is buff-coloured, pale red or brown to dark brown, sometimes banded or with dark streaks, not sharply demarcated from pale brown sapwood; grain straight, occasionally wavy; texture fine to coarse; wood fairly lustrous. It seasons well but may split slightly during seasoning; easy to work and takes a high finish. It is hard and strong. The wood is used for general construction, furniture and cabinet work, tool handles, agricultural implements, tent pegs, golf clubs, gun stocks, sandals, yokes, harrows, toys, turnery, household utensils, bowling pins, baseball bats, chisels and packaging. It is also suitable for the production of veneer and plywood. Basically, any product that needs a durable, close-grained wood can be made from it.
Shade or shelter:  The tree has been planted for shade and windbreaks.
Tannin or dyestuff:  The bark, including the root bark, has served in tanning; when pounded and mashed in water, it yields brown and grey or reddish dyes.
Medicine:  Leaves, fruits and bark are used medicinally. Pounded roots are added to drinking water and given to poultry suffering from diarrhoea and to humans for indigestion.
Ornamental: Z. mauritiana is well suited for homegardens.
Tree useful as a living fence; its spiny stems and branches deter livestock.
Alcohol:  A raw, intoxicating spirit is occasionally distilled from the fermented fruit pulp."

It is a very hardy species, most common in dry areas; it is resistant to both frost and drought. Regarded as an indicator of underground water.
Grows easily from direct sowing, seedlings, root suckers and natural regeneration. Remove the flesh and soak in cold water for 6 hours. Cover the seed in seedling trays with a thin layer of river sand and keep moist. Seeds usually germinate in 2-3 weeks with a minimum of 75% germination. Germination is epigeal. Seedlings transplant easily into black nursery soil but they have long taproots and care should be taken not to damage them. There are 700-1100 fruit/kg.
 The fruit, with thin, meally flesh and a sweetish taste, is eaten fresh or dried, in meal or porridge. The young leaves can be cooked and eaten as spinach; they are not very palatable but are nutritious. Seeds are roasted, crushed and used as a coffee substitute.
Fodder: A valuable fodder tree, especially in drier areas. Stock and game (giraffe, eland, kudu, sable, black wildebeest, nyala, impala, klipspringer, springbok, Sharpe’s greysbok, steenbok, Damara dik-dik and warthog) relish the highly nutritious leaves and fruit. 
Apiculture: Beekeepers consider Z. mucronata a valuable source of nectar.
The wood is hard and makes good firewood and charcoal.
Timber: The termite-resistant wood is used for building poles and posts, live and dry fences, and for hunting and fishing weaponry. Whips and bows are made from saplings and from the flexible shoots. Thorny branches are sometimes used to make kraals. 
Tannin or dyestuff: The bark contains 12-15% tannin.
Medicine: A wide remedy for almost any pain is a poultice of the powdered and baked roots, which are eaten after they are removed from the affected area. Boils and other skin infections are treated with leaf paste, and this, together with an infusion of the roots, is a treatment for tubercular gland swellings, measles, dysentery, lumbago and chest complaints. Roots are used to treat snakebite. The bark is used as an emetic; bark decoction is used for rheumatism and stomach troubles; bark infusion is used to treat coughs; and bark is used in a steam bath to purify the complexion.
A useful species to plant as a hedge around camps. It forms an impenetrable hedge for at least 10 years before the crown is too high off the ground to act as a barrier."

Poison: The fruits are greedily eaten by gerbils and rats and are used as baits for poisoning these rodents.
It has proved successful in sand dune stabilization in India.
Erosion control: The shrubs have been shown to effectively check wind erosion, help in deposition of soil, and bring about a change in the microhabitat, causing favourable conditions for the appearance of successional species such as perennial grasses
 The sweet and acidulous fruit is either eaten fresh, pickled, dried or made into confectionery. The juice can be made into a refreshing drink. In India, the fruit, when fully ripe and less than one centimeter in diameter, are gathered in the beginning of the winter months, dried, ground, and sieved. The powder formed is eaten either alone, mixed with Gur (a sugar condiment) or Bajra (millet) flour.
Fodder: The leaves of Z. nummularia provide excellent fodder for livestock. In India, the average total yield of forage was about 1000 kg ha-1. The leaves are collected dried and stored.
It is a source of high calorific value (4400 kcal/kg) fuel and charcoal
Timber: The heartwood is yellow to dark brown, hard, 738 kg/m3 and it is used in farm implements and for house construction.
Shade or shelter: It provides shade.
Medicine: Dried fruit used medicinally as astringent in bilious affliction in India. The leaves are used to treat scabies and other skin diseases.
In India, it is commonly erected as ‘brush-wood barriers’ (micro-windbreaks) together with Crotalaria burhia.
Intercropping: Z. nummularia shrubs are often intercropped with millet, legumes and oil seeds"
Zizyphus spina-christi,"Local names:
 Arabic (sidr,siddir,nubak,nabdag,nabbak,nabak,kurna), English (jujube,Christ thorn), French (epine du Christ)
Ziziphus spina-christi is a shrub, sometimes a tall tree, reaching a height of 20 m and a diameter of 60 cm; bark light-grey, very cracked, scaly; trunk twisted; very branched, crown thick; shoots whitish, flexible, drooping; thorns in pairs, one straight, the other curved.

Leaves glabrous on upper surface, finely pubescent below, ovate-lanceolate or ellipsoid, apex acute or obtuse, margins almost entire, lateral veins conspicuous.

Flowers in cymes, subsessile, peduncle 1-3 mm.

Fruit about 1 cm in diameter.

There are 2 varieties: var. spina-christi is a tree with white branches, leaves larger, ovate-lanceolate with an acute or obtuse apex, 2.5-8.5 cm long and 1-3.5 cm wide, margins slightly crenate, 3 strong veins from the base, lateral veins inconspicuous; flowers many per cyme, peduncle up to 1.5 cm; fruit 2 cm in diameter; var. microphylla Hochst ex A. Rich. is a very bushy shrub, leaves are widely ellipsoid or ovate-ellipsoid, rounded at the tip, 1-3 cm long and just as wide, margins almost entire, basal veins not reaching the apex, 1-2 strong lateral veins on each side of the central vein; branches brown-reddish; fruits up to 1 cm in diameter.

The name ‘Ziziphus’ is often erroneously written as Zizyphus. The generic name is derived from the latinized version of the Arabic vernacular name ‘zizouf’ for Z. jujuba. The specific name is derived from its common name Christ thorn.
Ecology

Z. spina-christi is native to a vast area of Africa stretching from Mauritania through the Sahara and Sahelian zones of west Africa to the Red Sea. It is drought hardy, very resistant to heat and can be found in desert areas with even 100 mm rainfall annually. It prefers edges of ponds, river and wadi banks where groundwater is available. The tree is frost tender, can withstand water logging for up to 2 months and 8-10 months of dry season. It is an aggressive colonizer, forming spiny, impenetrable thickets.
Native range
Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Somalia, Tunisia, Turkey, Zimbabwe
Tree management

The tree develops an extremely deep taproot and has extraordinary regenerative power. It is an aggressive colonizer, coppices well and is long lived, forming spiny, impenetrable thickets.
There are 15 000 seeds/kg. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability is maintained in hermitic air-dry storage and cool temperatures. The hard, woody shells of the seeds should be cracked with a hammer and the shelled seeds soaked overnight in lukewarm water or scarified in concentrated sulphuric acid for 2 hours then cold stratified before planting.

Propagation is by bare-rooted seedlings and cuttings. 60-80 % germination is realized, seedlings growth rate is medium reaching plantable size in 4-5 months in the nursery.
Poison:  It has been reported that applying Christ thorn bark in larger doses reduces nematode activity in cereal fields and leads to significant increase in the yield of sunflowers (Ismail, 1998).
Erosion control:  Because it develops a very deep taproot and spreading lateral roots, it is used for stabilizing sand dunes and other unstable soils.
  The fruit is edible and occasionally sweet, but the flavour and texture are inferior to other Ziziphus spp. which have been domesticated in Africa and especially in northern India. Average size is about 50 g, with a single large seed. The fruits contain 14.16% sugar  and about 1.6% vitamin C.
The leaves provide valuable animal forage and fodder under open grazing conditions, but the nutritional value is apparently not high for most domestic livestock. The fruits are eaten by sheep and goats and the foliage by camels.
Its wood  yields an excellent charcoal,  but given the current status of the species, and its slow growth rate, this usage is certainly to be discouraged.
Timber:  The termite resistant red or dark brown wood is hard and heavy, used for spear shafts, posts, roofing beams, utensils and cabinet making.
Shade or shelter:  Christ thorn is planted around towns and villages for shade. It makes useful windbreaks and shelterbelts.
Medicine: The leaves contain various alcaloids, including ziziphine, jubanine and amphibine, alpha terpinol, linalol and diverse saponins. In the Sahel region, the roots are used to treat headaches, while the spines or ashes of this species are applied to snake bites. Boiled leaves are applied to various surface wounds, and also have antihelminthic and anti-diarrhetic properties. In Egypt and the southern Sahara, a narcotic beverage is made from the fruits and which is considered to be a tranquilliser and sedative. In Morocco, the fruits are used as an emollient and astringent agent. It also is reputed to reduce abscesses and boils while a cataplasm of young leaves is also used to reduce eye inflammations. 
The thorny branches are used for fencing. It can also be grown to form a stock-proof living fence.
Soil improver:  The tree improves soil quality by increasing available Phosphorus.
Intercropping:  Z. spina-christi is intercropped with millet in West Africa.
Alcohol:  An alcoholic drink is made from the fruits."
